* PART ONE *

Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dol y at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.

Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at al had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns. 2

I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gentle, easy-going person, a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed French and Austrian descent, with a dash of the Danube in his veins. I am going to pass around in a minute some lovely, glossy-blue picture postcards.

He owned a luxurious hotel on the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers had sold wine, jewels and silk, respectively. At thirty he married an English girl, daughter of Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter of two Dorset parsons, experts in obscure subjects-paleopedology and Aeolian harps, respectively. M y very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hol ows and del s of memory, over which, if you can stil stand my style (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely, you al know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hil , in the summer dusk; a furry warmth, golden midges.

My mother's elder sister, Sybil, whom a cousin of my father's had married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared. I was extremely fond of her, despite the rigidity-the fatal rigidity-of some of her rules. Perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the ful ness of time, a better widower than my father. Aunt Sybil had pink-rimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. She wrote poetry. She was poetical y superstitious. She said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday, and did. Her husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in America, where eventual y he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.

I grew, a happy, healthy child in a bright would of il ustrated books, clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces. Around me the splendid Hotel Mirana revolved as a kind of private universe, a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside. From the aproned pot-scrubber to the flanneled potentate, everybody liked me, everybody petted me. Elderly American ladies leaning on their canes listed towards me like towers of Pisa. Ruined Russian princesses who could not pay my father, bought me expensive bonbons. He, moncher petit papa, took me out boating and biking, taught me to swim and dive and water-ski, read to me Don Quixote and Les Miserables, and I adored and respected him and felt glad for him whenever I overheard the servants Page 1

discuss his various lady-friends, beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness. I attended an English day school a few miles from home, and there I played rackets and fives, and got excel ent marks, and was on perfect terms with schoolmates and teachers alike. The only definite sexual events that I can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday (that is, before I first saw my little Annabel) were: a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school with an American kid, the son of a then celebrated motion-picture actress whom he seldom saw in the three-dimensional world; and some interesting reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs, pearl and um bra, with infinitely soft partings, in Pichon's sumptuous Le Beaute Humaine that that I had filched from under a mountain of marble-bound Graphics in the hotel library. Later, in his delightful debonair manner, my father gave me al the information he thought I needed about sex; this was just before sending me, in the autumn of 1923, to a lycÃ©e in Lyon (where we were to spend three winters); but alas, in the summer of that year, he was touring Italy with M me de R. and her daughter, and I had nobody to com plain to, nobody to consult. 3

Annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage: half-English, half-Dutch, in her case. I rem em ber her features far less distinctly today than I did a few years ago, before I knew Lolita. There are two kinds of visual memory: one when you skil ful y recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in such general terms as: "honey-colored skin," "think arms," "brown bobbed hair," "long lashes," "big bright mouth"); and the other when you instantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical replica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors (and this is how I see Lolita). Let me therefore primly limit myself, in describing Annabel, to saying she was a lovely child a few months my junior. Her parents were old friends of my aunt's, and as stuffy as she. They had rented a vil a not far from Hotel Mirana. Bald brown M r. Leigh and fat, powdered Mrs. Leigh (born Vanessa van Ness). How I loathed them! At first, Annabel and I talked of peripheral affairs. She kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it pour through her fingers. Our brains were turned the way those of intel igent European preadolescents were in our day and set, and I doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity, solipsism and so on. The softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain. She wanted to be a nurse in some famished Asiatic country; I wanted to be a famous spy.

Al at once we were madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love with each other; hopelessly, I should add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actual y imbibing and assimilating every particle of each other's soul and flesh; but there we were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do. After one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her garden (of which more later), the only privacy we were al owed was to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the plague. There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl al morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other: her hand, half-hidden in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer; then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey; sometimes a chance ram part built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each other's salty lips; these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we stil clawed at each other, could bring relief. Page 2

Among some treasures I lost during the wanderings of my adult years, there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed Annabel, her parents and the staid, elderly, lame gentleman, a Dr. Cooper, who that same summer courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe. Annabel did not com e out wel , caught as she was in the act of bending over her chocolat glaceÃ©, and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were about al that could be identified (as I remember that picture) am id the sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded; but I, sitting somewhat apart from the rest, cam e out with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness: a moody, beetle-browed boy in a dark sport shirt and wel -tailored white shorts, his legs crossed, sitting in profile, looking away. That photograph was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate. Under the flimsiest of pretexts (this was our very last chance, and nothing real y mattered) we escaped from the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand, and there, in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave, had a brief session of avid caresses, with somebody's lost pair of sunglasses for only witness. I was on my knees, and on the point of possessing my darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and his brother, cam e out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement, and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu.

I leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep asking myself, was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that the rift in my life began; or was my excessive desire for that child only the first evidence of an inherent singularity? W hen I try to analyze my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, I surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and re-fork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past. I am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita began with Annabel.

I also know that the shock of Annabel's death consolidated the frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a perm anent obstacle to any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. The spiritual and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain incomprehensible to the matter-of-fact, crude, standard brained youngsters of today. Long after her death I felt her thoughts floating through mine. Long before we met we had had the same dream s. W e com pared notes. W e found strange affinities. The same June of the same year (1919) a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine, in two widely separated countries. Oh, Lolita, had you loved me thus!

I have reserved for the conclusion of my "Annabel" phase the account of our unsuccessful first tryst. One night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family. In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa grove at the back of their vil a we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wal . Through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory, appear to me now like playing cards-presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy. She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves; that vibrant sky seem ed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky, strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. Her legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it sought, a dream y and eerie expression, half-pleasure, half-pain, came over those childish features. She sat a little higher than I, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head would bend with a sleepy, soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and com pressed my wrist, Page 3

and slackened again; and her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath cam e near to my face. She would try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine; then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again com e darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth, while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion.

I recal the scent of some kind of toilet powder-I believe she stole it from her mother's Spanish maid-a sweetish, lowly, musky perfume. It mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly fil ed to the brim; a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from overflowing-and as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there cam e from the house her mother's voice cal ing her, with a rising frantic note-and Dr. Cooper ponderously limped out into the garden. But that mimosa grove-the haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey-dew, and the ache remained with me, and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever since-until at last, twenty-four years later, I broke her spel by incarnating her in another.

The days of my youth, as I look back on them , seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car. In my sanitary relations with women I was practical, ironical and brisk. While a col ege student, in London and Paris, paid ladies sufficed me. M y studies were meticulous and intense, although not particularly fruitful. At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry and many manquÃ©

talents do; but I was even more manquÃ© than that; a peculiar exhaustion, I am so oppressed, doctor, set in; and I switched to English literature, where so many frustrated poets end as pipe-smoking teachers in tweeds. Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates. I sat with uranists in the Deux Magots. I published tortuous essays in obscure journals. I com posed pastiches:

...FrÃ¤ulen von Kulp

may turn, her hand upon the door;

I wil not fol ow her. Nor Fresca. Nor that Gul .

A paper of mine entitled "The Proustian them e in a letter from Keats to Benjamin Bailey" was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it. I launched upon an "Histoire abregee de la poesie anglaise" for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to com pile that manual of French literature for English-speaking students (with comparisons drawn from English writers) which was to occupy me throughout the forties-and the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest. I found a jobteaching English to a group of adults in Auteuil. Then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. Now and then I took advantage of the acquaintances I had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dream s. Now I wish to introduce the fol owing idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not hum an, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as "nymphets." It wil be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In fact, I would have the reader see "nine" and

"fourteen" as the boundaries-the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks-of an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a Page 4

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

vast, misty sea. Between those age limits, are al girl-children nymphets? Of course not. Otherwise, we who are in the know, we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would have long gone insane. Neither are good looks any criterion; and vulgarity, or at least what a given com m unity terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty, soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes. Within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is trickingly inferior to that of provisional y plain, or just nice, or "cute," or even "sweet" and

"attractive," ordinary, plumpish, formless, cold-skinned, essential y hum an little girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty (look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen). A normal man given a group photograph of school girls or Girl Scouts and asked to point out the comeliest one wil not necessarily choose the nymphet among them . You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super-voluptuous flam e permanently aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable signs-the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and sham e and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate-the little deadly demon among the wholesome children; she stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power. Furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years, never less than ten I should say, general y thirty or forty, and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to enable the latter to com e under a nymphet's spel . It is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thril s to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight. W hen I was a child and she was a child, my little Annabel was no nymphet to me; I was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same enchanted island of time; but today, in September 1952, after twenty-nine years have elapsed, I think I can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. W e loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. I was a strong lad and survived; but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon I found myself maturing am id a civilization which al ows a man of twenty-five to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve. No wonder, then, that my adult life during the European period of my existence proved monstrously twofold. Overtly, I had so-cal ed normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears for breasts; only, I was consumed by a hel furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as a law-abiding poltroon I never dared approach. The hum an fem ales I was al owed to wield were but pal iative agents. I am ready to believe that the sensations I derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. The trouble was that those gentlemen had not, and I had, caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss. The dimmest of my pol utive dream s was a thousand times more dazzling than al the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. M y world was split. I was aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine; both would be termed fem ale by the anatomist. But to me, through the prism of my senses,

"they were as different as mist and mast." Al this I rationalize now. In my twenties and early thirties, I did not understand my throes quite so clearly. While my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my body's every plea. One moment I was ashamed and Page 5

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

frightened, another recklessly optimistic. Taboos strangulated me. Psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudo-liberations of pseudo-libidoes. The fact that to me the only object of amorous tremor were sisters of Annabel's, her handmaids and girl-pages, appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. At other times I would tel myself that it was al a question of attitude, that there was real y nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girl-children. Let me remind my reader that in England, with the passage of the Children and Young Person Act in 1933, the term "girl-child" is defined as "a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years" (after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory definition is

"young person"). In Massachusetts, U.S., on the other hand, a "wayward child" is, technical y, one "between seven and seventeen years of age" (who, moreover, habitual y associates with vicious or immoral persons). Hugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of James the First, has proved that Rahab was a harlot at ten years of age. This is al very interesting, and I daresay you see me already frothing at the mouth in a fit; but no, I am not; I am just winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. Here are some more pictures. Here is Virgil who could the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lad's perineum . Here are two of King Akhnaten's and Queen Nefertiti's prenubile Nile daughters (that royal couple had a litter of six), wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. Here are some brides of ten compel ed to seat them selves on the fascinum, the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. Marriage and cohabitation before the age of puberty are stil not uncommon in certain East Indian provinces. Lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and nobody minds. After al , Dante fel madly in love with Beatrice when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely, and bejeweled, in a crimson frock, and this was in 1274, in Florence, at a private feast in the merry month of M ay. And when Petrarch fel madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fairhaired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the pol en and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from the hil s of Vaucluse.

But let us be prim and civilized. Humbert Humbert tried hard to be good. Real y and truly, he id. He had the utmost respect for ordinary children, with their purity and vulnerability, and under no circum stances would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the least risk of a row. But how his heart beat when, am ong the innocent throng, he espied a demon child, "enfant charmante et fourbe," dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her. So life went. Humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for. The budstage of breast development appears early (10.7 years) in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. And the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic hair (11.2 years). M y little cup brims with tiddles. A shipwreck. An atol . Alone with a drowned passenger's shivering child. Darling, this is only a game! How marvelous were my fancied adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book. Around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely, as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old tree's shadow and sheen. Once a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and righten the strap of her rol er skate, and I dissolved in the sun, with my book for fig leaf, as her auburn ringlets fel al over her skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves I shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb next to my chameloenic cheek. Another time a red-haired school girl hung over me in the metro, and a revelation of axil ary russet I obtained remained in my blood for weeks. I could list a great number of these one-sided diminutive romances. Some of them ended in a rich flavor of hel . It happened for instance that from my balcony I would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of Page 6

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

undressing before a co-operative mirror. Thus isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especial y keen charm that made me race with al speed toward my lone gratification. But abruptly, fiendishly, the tender pattern of nudity I had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lam p-lit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, dam p, hopeless summer night. Rope-skipping, hopscotch. That old woman in black who sat down next to me on my bench, on my rack of joy (a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble), and asked if I had stomachache, the insolent hag. Ah, leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. Let them play around me forever. Never grow up. 6

A propos: I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later? In this wroughtiron would of criss-cross cause and effect, could it be that the hidden throb I stole from them did not affect their future? I had possessed her-and she never knew it. Al right. But would it not tel sometime later? Had I not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas? Oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and terrible wonder.

I learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely, maddening, thin-armed nymphets, when they grew up. I remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the Madeleine. A short slim girl passed me at a rapid, highheeled, tripping step, we glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and I accosted her. She cam e hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round little face French girls so often have, and I liked her long lashes and tight-fitting tailored dress sheathing in pearl-gray her young body which stil retained-and that was the nymphic echo, the chil of delight, the leap in my loins-a childish something mingling with the professional fretil ement of her smal agile rum p. I asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision (a bird, a very bird!) "Cent." I tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat (a band, a posy); and with one beat of her lashes:

"Tant pis," she said, and made as if to move away. Perhaps only three years earlier I might have seen her coming home from school! That evocation settled the matter. She led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bel clearing the way for the monsieur who might not care to meet another monsieur, on the mournful climb to the abject room , al bed and bidet. As usual, she asked at once for her petit cadeau, and as usual I asked her name (Monique) and her age (eighteen). I was pretty wel acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers. They al answer "dix-huit"-a trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per day, the poor little creatures. But in Monique's case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age. This I deduced from many details of her com pact, neat, curiously immature body. Having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as pat could be, to an organ-grinder in the dust-brimming courtyard below. W hen I examined her smal hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails, she said with a naive frown "Oui, ce n'est pas bien," and went to the wash-basin, but I said it did not matter, did not matter at al . With her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. Her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad; in fact, I do not hesitate to say (and indeed this is the reason why I linger grateful y in that gauzegray room of memory with little Monique) that among the eighty or so grues I had had operate upon me, she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure. "Il etait malin, celui qui a invente ce truc-la," she commented amiably, and got back into her clothes with the same high-style speed.

I asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening, and she said she Page 7

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and swore she had never pose un lapin in al her young life. W e returned to the same room , and I could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely: "Tu es bien gentil de dire ca" and then, noticing what I noticed too in the mirror reflecting our smal Eden-the dreadful grim ace of clenched-teeth tenderness that distorted my mouth-dutiful little Monique (oh, she had been a nymphet, al right!) wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips avant qu'on se couche in case I planned to kiss her. Of course, I planned it. I let myself go with her more completely than I had with any young lady before, and my last vision that night of long-lashed Monique is touched up with a gaiety that I find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn love life. She looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty I gave her as she trotted out into the April night drizzle with Humbert Humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. Stopping before a window display she said with great gusto: "Je vais m'acheter des bas!" and never may I forget the way her Parisian childish lips exploded on "bas," pronouncing it with an appetite that al but changed the "a" into a brief buoyant bursting "o" as in "bot". I had a date with her next day at 2.15 P.M . in my own room s, but it was less successful, she seem ed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight. A cold I caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment, nor was I sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heart-rending fantasies and peter out in dul disappointment. So let her remain, sleek, slender Monique, as she was for a minute or two: a delinquent nymphet shining through the matter-of-fact young whore. M y brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. An advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave day, in the office of a M l e Edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a col ection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album ("Regardezmoi cette bel e brune!". W hen I pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door; however, after asking me what price I was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch with a person qui pourrait arranger la chose. Next day, an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky, with an almost farcical ProvenÃ§al accent and a black mustache above a purple lip, took me to what was apparently her own dom icile, and there, after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrical y drew aside a curtain to reveal what I judged was that part of the room where a large and unfastidious family usual y slept. It was now empty save for a monstrously plump, sal ow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with red-ribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald dol . W hen I shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess' torso; then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded son argent. A door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen, bare-necked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. A smal boy and a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them . With the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police, lui, so that I had better do as I was told. I went up to Marie-for that was her stel ar name-who by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the dol . With a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, I thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift to the ex-detective, whereupon I was suffered to leave. 7

I do not know if the pimp's album may not have been another link in the daisy-chain; but soon after, for my own safety, I decided to marry. It occurred to me that regular hours, Page 8

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

home-cooked meals, al the conventions of marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and, who knows, the eventual flowering of certain moral values, of certain spiritual substitutes, might help me, if not to purge myself of my degrading and dangerous desires, at least to keep them under pacific control. A little money that had com e my way after my father's death (nothing very grand-the Mirana had been sold long before), in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks, al owed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. After considerable deliberation, my choice fel on the daughter of a Polish doctor: the good man happened to be treating me for spel s of dizziness and tachycardia. W e played chess; his daughter watched me from behind her easel, and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs. Let me repeat with quiet force: I was, and stil am , despite mesmalheurs, an exceptional y handsome male; slowmoving, tal , with soft dark hair and a gloom y but al the more seductive cast of demeanor. Exceptional virility often reflects in the subject's displayable features a sul en and congested something that pertains to what he has to conceal. And this was my case. W el did I know, alas, that I could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult fem ale I chose; in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they com e toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap. Had I been a francaismoyen with a taste for flashy ladies, I might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that lashed my grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than Valeria. M y choice, however, was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as I realized too late, a piteous com promise. Al of which goes to show how dreadful y stupid poor Humbert always was in matters of sex.

Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a glorified pot-aufeu, an animated merkin, what real y attracted me to Valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. She gave it not because she had divined something about me; it was just her style-and I fel for it. Actual y, she was at least in her late twenties (I never established her exact age for even her passport lied) and had mislaid her virginity under circum stances that changed with her reminiscent moods. I, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be. She looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed a la gamine, showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and drindled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable. After a brief ceremony at the mairie, I tool her to the new apartment I had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear, before I touched her, a girl's plain nightshirt that I had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. I derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. But reality soon asserted itself. The bleached curl revealed its melanic root; the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin; the mobile moist mouth, no matter how I stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama; and presently, instead of a pale little gutter girl, Humbert Humbert had on his hands a large, puffy, shortlegged, big-breasted and practical y brainless baba. This state of affairs lasted from 1935 to 1939. Her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of com fort in our smal squalid flat: two room s, a hazy view in one window, a brick wal in the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoe-shaped bath tub, within which I felt like Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me. W e had quite a few cozy evenings together, she deep in her Paris-Soir, I working at a rickety table. W e went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. I appealed to her stale flesh very seldom , only in cases of great urgency and despair. The grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad; but with Valeria's help I did find after al some Page 9

legal outlets to my fantastic predicament. As to cooking, we tacitly dismissed the potaufeu and had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue Bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. And next door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red, golden and inky blue, ancient American estampe-a locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of spark-studded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.

These burst. In the summer of 1939 mononcle d'AmÃ©rique died bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dol ars on condition I cam e to live in the States and showed some interest in his business. This prospect was most welcome to me. I felt my life needed a shake-up. There was another thing, too: moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial com fort. During the last weeks I had kept noticing that my fat Valeria was not her usual self; had acquired a queer restlessness; even showed something like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was supposed to impersonate. W hen I informed her we were shortly to sail for New York, she looked distressed and bewildered. There were some tedious difficulties with her papers. She had a Nansen, or better say Nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husband's solid Swiss citizenship could not easily transcend; and I decided it was the necessity of queuing in the prÃ©fecture, and other formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her America, the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an improvement on dul dingy Paris. W e were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers almost in order, when Valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. I let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside. She answered (I translate from her French which was, I imagine, a translation in its turn of some Slavic platitude): "There is another man in my life."

Now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. They dazed me, I confess. To beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. Years of secret sufferings had taught me superhuman self-control. So I ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this comparative privacy I quietly suggested she comment her wild talk. Amounting fury was suffocating me-not because I had any particular fondness for that figure of fun, M me Humbert, but because matters of legal and il egal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, Valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my com fort and fate. I demanded her lover's name. I repeated my question; but she kept up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immediate divorce. "Mais quiest-ce?" I shouted at last, striking her on the knee with my fist; and she, without even wincing, stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. He pul ed up at a smal cafÃ© and introduced himself. I do not remember his ridiculous name but after al those years I stil see him quite clearly-a stocky White Russian ex-colonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut; there were thousands of them plying that fool's trade in Paris. W e sat down at a table; the Tsarist ordered wine, and Valeria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on talking-into me rather than to me; she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility I had never suspected she had in her. And every now and then she would vol ey a burst of Slavic at her stolid lover. The situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxicolonel, stopping Valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold his views and plans. With an atrocious accent to his careful French, he delineated the world of love and work Page 10

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his child-wife Valeria. She by now was preening herself, between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blouse-bosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one; and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions, I can swear that he actual y consulted me on such things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read. "I think," - he said, "She wil like Jean Christophe?" Oh, he was quite a scholar, M r. Taxovich.

I put an end to this gibberish by suggesting Valeria pack up her few belongings immediately, upon which the platitudinous colonel gal antly offered to carry them into the car. Reverting to his professional state, he drove the Humberts to their residence and al the way Valeria talked, and Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Smal whether Humbert Humbert should kil her or her lover, or both, or neither. I rem em ber once handling an automatic belonging to a fel ow student, in the days (I have not spoken of them , I think, but never mind) when I toyed with the idea of enjoying his little sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow, and then shooting myself. I now wondered if Valechka (as the colonel cal ed her) was real y worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. She had very vulnerable legs, and I decided I would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone.

But we never were. Valechka-by now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow make-up,-started to fil anyhow a trunk, and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a running kick at her rum p were of course impossible to put into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around al the time. I cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that; on the contrary, he displayed, as a smal sideshow in the theatricals I had been inveigled in, a discreet old-world civility, punctuating his movements with al sorts of mispronounced apologies (j'ai demande pardonne-excuse me-est-ce que j'ai puis-m ay I-and so forth), and turning away tactful y when Valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub; but he seem ed to be al over the place at once, le gredin, agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rol ing a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom

, helping his mol to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. I sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sil , dying of hate and boredom . At last both were out of the quivering apartment-the vibration of the door I had slammed after them stil rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which I ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. Clumsily playing my part, I stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my English toilet water; they had not; but I noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the former Counselor of the Tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not flushed the toilet. That solemn pool of alien urine with a soggy, tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and I wildly looked around for a weapon. Actual y I daresay it was nothing but middle-class Russian courtesy (with an oriental tang, perhaps) that had prompted the good colonel (Maximovich! his name suddenly taxies back to me), a very formal person as they al are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the smal size of his host's domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. But this did not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage I ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom . Then, canceling my search, I dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted; despite my natural vigor, I am no pugilist, while the short but broad-shouldered M aximovich seem ed made of pig iron. The void of the street, Page 11

revealing nothing of my wife's departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. But no matter. I had my little revenge in due time. A man from Pasadena told me one day that M rs. Maximovich nÃ©e Zborovski had died in childbirth around 1945; the couple had somehow got over to California and had been used there, for an excel ent salary, in a year-long experiment conducted by a distinguished American ethnologist. The experiment dealt with hum an and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on al fours. M y informant, a doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese Valechka and her colonel, by then gray-haired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the wel -swept floors of a brightly lit set of room s (fruit in one, water in another, mats in a third and so on) in the company of several other hired quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. I tried to find the results of these tests in the Review of Anthropology; but they appear not to have been published yet. These scientific products take of course some time to fructuate. I hope they wil be il ustrated with photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison library wil harbor such erudite works. The one to which I am restricted these days, despite my lawyer's favors, is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison libraries. They have the Bible, of course, and Dickens (an ancient set, N.Y., G.W . Dil ingham , Publisher, M DCCCLXXXVI ); and the Children's Encyclopedia (with some nice photographs of sunshine-haired Girl Scouts in shorts), and A Murder Is Announced by Agatha Christie; but they also have such coruscating trifles as A vagabond in Italy by Percy Elphinstone, author of Venice Revisited, Boston, 1868, and a comparatively recent (1946) Who's W ho in the Limelight-actors, producers, playwrights, and shots of static scenes. In looking through the latter volume, I was treated last night to one of those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets love. I transcribe most of the page:

Pym , Roland. Born in Lundy, M ass., 1922. Received stage training at Elsinore Playhouse, Derby, N.Y. Made debut in Sunburst. Among his many appearances are Two Blocks from Here, The Girl in Green, Scram bled Husbands, The Strange Mushroom , Touch and Go, John Lovely, I W as Dreaming of You.

Quilty, Clare, American dramatist. Born in Ocean City, N.J., 1911. Educated at Columbia University. Started on a commercial career but turned to playwriting. Author of The Little Nymph, The Lady W ho Loved Lightning (in col aboration with Vivian Darkbloom), Dark Age, The strange Mushroom , Fatherly Love, and others. His many plays for children are notable. Little Nymph (1940) traveled 14,000 miles and played 280

performances on the road during the winter before ending in New York. Hobbies: fast cars, photography, pets.

Quine, Dolores. Born in 1882, in Dayton, Ohio. Studied for stage at American Academy. First played in Ottawa in 1900. Made New York debut in 1904 in Never Talk to Strangers. Has disappeared since in [a list of some thirty plays fol ows]. How the look of my dear love's name even affixed to some old hag of an actress, stil makes me rock with helpless pain! Perhaps, she might have been an actress too. Born 1935. Appeared (I notice the slip of my pen in the preceding paragraph, but please do not correct it, Clarence) in The Murdered Playwright. Quine the Swine. Guilty of kil ing Quilty. Oh, my Lolita, I have only words to play with!

Divorce proceedings delayed my voyage, and the gloom of yet another World War had settled upon the globe when, after a winter of ennui and pneumonia in Portugal, I at last reached the States. In New York I eagerly accepted the soft job fate offered me: it consisted mainly of thinking up and editing perfume ads. I welcomed its desultory character and pseudoliterary aspects, attending to it whenever I had nothing better to do. Page 12

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

On the other hand, I was urged by a war-time university in New York to complete my comparative history of French literature for English-speaking students. The first volume took me a couple of years during which I put in seldom less than fifteen hours of work daily. As I look back on those days, I see them divided tidily into ample light and narrow shade: the light pertaining to the solace of research in palatial libraries, the shade to my excruciating desires and insomnias of which enough has been said. Knowing me by now, the reader can easily imagine how dusty and hot I got, trying to catch a glimpse of nymphets (alas, always remote) playing in Central Park, and how repulsed I was by the glitter of deodorized career girls that a gay dog in one of the offices kept unloading upon me. Let us skip al that. A dreadful breakdown sent me to a sanatorium for more than a year; I went back to my work-only to be hospitalized again.

Robust outdoor life seem ed to promise me some relief. One of my favorite doctors, a charming cynical chap with a little brown beard, had a brother, and this brother was about to lead an expedition into arctic Canada. I was attached to it as a "recorder of psychic reactions." With two young botanists and an old carpenter I shared now and then (never very successful y) the favors of one of our nutritionists, a Dr. Anita Johnson-who was soon flown back, I am glad to say. I had little notion of what object the expedition was pursuing. Judging by the number of meteorologists upon it, we may have been tracking to its lair (somewhere on Prince of W ales' Island, I understand) the wandering and wobbly north magnetic pole. One group, jointly with the Canadians, established a weather station on Pierre Point in Melvil e Sound. Another group, equal y misguided, col ected plankton. A third studied tuberculosis in the tundra. Bert, a film photographer-an insecure fel ow with whom at one time I was made to partake in a good deal of menial work (he, too, had some psychic troubles)-maintained that the big men on our team , the real leaders we never saw, were mainly engaged in checking the influence of climatic amelioration on the coats of the arctic fox.

W e lived in prefabricated timber cabins am id a Pre-Cambrian world of granite. W e had heaps of supplies-the Reader's Digest, an ice cream mixer, chemical toilets, paper caps for Christmas. M y health improved wonderful y in spite or because of al the fantastic blankness and boredom . Surrounded by such dejected vegetation as wil ow scrub and lichens; permeated, and, I suppose, cleansed by a whistling gale; seated on a boulder under a completely translucent sky (through which, however, nothing of importance showed), I felt curiously aloof from my own self. No temptations maddened me. The plum p, glossy little Eskimo girls with their fish smel , hideous raven hair and guinea pig faces, evoked even less desire in me than Dr. Johnson had. Nymphets do not occur in polar regions.

I left my betters the task of analyzing glacial drifts, drumlins, and gremlins, and kremlins, and for a time tried to jot down what I fondly thought were "reactions" (I noticed, for instance, that dream s under the midnight sun tended to be highly colored, and this my friend the photographer confirmed). I was also supposed to quiz my various companions on a number of important matters, such as nostalgia, fear of unknown animals, food fantasies, nocturnal emissions, hobbies, choice of radio program s, changes in outlook and so forth. Everybody got so fed up with this that I soon dropped the project completely, and only toward the end of my twenty months of cold labor (as one of the botanists jocosely put it) concocted a perfectly spurious and very racy report that the reader wil find published in he Annals of Adult Psychophysics for 1945 or 1946, as wel as in the issue of Arctic Explorations devoted to that particular expedition; which, in conclusion, was not real y concerned with Victoria Island copper or anything like that, as I learned later from my genial doctor; for the nature of its real purpose was what is termed

"hushhush," and so let me add merely that whatever it was, that purpose was admirably achieved.

The reader wil regret to learn that soon after my return to civilization I had another bout with insanity (if to melancholia and a sense of insufferable oppression that cruel term must be applied). I owe my complete restoration to a discovery I made while being treated at that particular very expensive sanatorium . I discovered there was an endless source of robust enjoyment in trifling with psychiatrists: cunningly leading them on; never letting them see that you know al the tricks of the trade; inventing for them elaborate dream s, pure classics in style (which make them , the dream -extortionists, dream and wake up shrieking); teasing them with fake "primal scenes"; and never al owing them the slightest glimpse of one's real sexual predicament. By bribing a nurse I won access to som e files and discovered, with glee, cards cal ing me "potential y homosexual" and

"total y im potent." The sport was so excel ent, its results-in my case-so ruddy that I stayed on for a whole month after I was quite wel (sleeping admirably and eating like a schoolgirl). And then I added another week just for the pleasure of taking on a powerful newcomer, a displaced (and, surely, deranged) celebrity, known for his knack of making patients believe they had witnessed their own conception.

Upon signing out, I cast around for some place in the New England countryside or sleepy smal town (elms, white church) where I could spend a studious summer subsisting on a com pact boxful of notes I had accumulated and bathing in some nearby lake. M y work had begun to interest me again-I mean my scholarly exertions; the other thing, my active participation in my uncle's posthumous perfumes, had by then been cut down to a minimum.

One of his former employees, the scion of a distinguished family, suggested I spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins, a M r. McCoo, retired, and his wife, who wanted to let their upper story where a late aunt had delicately dwelt. He said they had two little daughters, one a baby, the other a girl of twelve, and a beautiful garden, not far from a beautiful lake, and I said it sounded perfectly perfect. I exchanged letters with these people, satisfying them I was housebroken, and spent a fantastic night on the train, imagining in al possible detail the enigmatic nymphet I would coach in French and fondle in Humbertish. Nobody met me at the toy station where I alighted with my new expensive bag, and nobody answered the telephone; eventual y, however, a distraught McCoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of green-and-pink Ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned down-possibly, owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging al night in my veins. His family, he said, had fled to a farm he owned, and had taken the car, but a friend of his wife's, a grand person, Mrs. Haze of 342 Lawn Street, offered to accommodate me. A lady who lived opposite Mrs. Haze's had lent McCoo her limousine, a marvelously old-fashioned, square-topped affair, manned by a cheerful Negro. Now, since the only reason for my coming at al had vanished, the aforesaid arrangement seem ed preposterous. Al right, his house would have to be completely rebuilt, so what? Had he not insured it sufficiently? I was angry, disappointed and bored, but being a polite European, could not refuse to be sent off to Lawn Street in that funeral car, feeling that otherwise McCoo would devise an even more elaborate means of getting rid of me. I saw him scam per away, and my chauffeur shook his head with a soft chuckle. En route, I swore to myself I would not dream of staying in Ramsdale under any circum stance but would fly that very day to the Bermudas or the Bahamas or the Blazes. Possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had been trickling through my spine for some time before, and McCoo's cousin had, in fact, sharply diverted that train of thought with his wel -meaning but as it transpired now absolutely inane suggestion.

Speaking of sharp turns: we almost ran over a meddlesome suburban dog (one of those who like in wait for cars) as we swerved into Lawn Street. A little further, the Haze Page 14

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

house, a white-frame horror, appeared, looking dingy and old, more gray than white-the kind of place you know wil have a rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower. I tipped the chauffeur and hoped he would immediately drive away so that I might double back unnoticed to my hotel and bag; but the man merely crossed to the other side of the street where an old lady was cal ing to him from her porch. W hat could I do? I pressed the bel button.

A colored maid let me in-and left me standing on the mat while she rushed back to the kitchen where something was burning that ought not to burn.

The front hal was graced with door chimes, a white-eyed wooden thingamabob of commercial Mexican origin, and that banal darling of the arty middle class, van Gogh's

"ArlÃ©sienne." A door ajar to the right afforded a glimpse of a living room , with some more Mexican trash in a corner cabinet and a striped sofa along the wal . There was a staircase at the end of the hal way, and as I stood mopping my brow (only now did I realize how hot it had been out-of-doors) and staring, to stare at something, at an old gray tennis bal that lay on an oak chest, there cam e from the upper landing the contralto voice of Mrs. Haze, who leaning over the banisters inquired melodiously, "Is that Monsieur Humbert?" A bit of cigarette ash dropped from there in addition. Presently, the lady herself-sandals, maroon slacks, yel ow silk blouse, squarish face, in that order-cam e down the steps, her index finger stil tapping upon her cigarette. I think I had better describe her right away, to get it over with. The poor lady was in her middle thirties, she had a shiny forehead, plucked eyebrows and quite simple but not unattractive features of a type that may be defined as a weak solution of Marlene Dietrich. Patting her bronzebrown bun, she led me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about the McCoo fire and the privilege of living in Ramsdale. Her very wide-set sea-green eyes had a funny way of traveling al over you, careful y avoiding your own eyes. Her smile was but a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow; and uncoiling herself from the sofa as she talked, she kept making spasmodic dashes at three ashtrays and the near fender (where lay the brown core of an apple); whereupon she would sink back again, one leg folded under her. She was, obviously, one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul; women who are completely devoid of hum or; women utterly indifferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation, but very particular about the rules of such conversations, through the sunny cel ophane of which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished. I was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance I became her lodger, she would methodical y proceed to do in regard to me what taking a lodger probably meant to her al along, and I would again be enmeshed in one of those tedious affairs I knew so wel .

But there was no question of my settling there. I could not be happy in that type of household with bedraggled magazines on every chair and a kind of horrible hybridization between the comedy of so-cal ed "functional modern furniture" and the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lam p tables with dead lamps. I was led upstairs, and to the left-into "m y" room . I inspected it through the mist of my utter rejection of it; but I did discern above "m y" bed RenÃ© Prinet's "Kreutzer Sonata." And she cal ed that servant maid's room a "semi-studio"! Let's get out of here at once, I firmly said to myself as I pretended to deliberate over the absurdly, and ominously, low price that my wistful hostess was asking for board and bed.

Old-world politeness, however, obliged me to go on with the ordeal. W e crossed the landing to the right side of the house (where "I and Lo have our room s"-Lo being presumably the maid), and the lodger-lover could hardly conceal a shudder when he, a very fastidious male, was granted a preview of the only bathroom , a tiny oblong between the landing and "Lo's" room , with limp wet things overhanging the dubious tub (the Page 15

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

question mark of a hair inside); and there were the expected coils of the rubber snake, and its complement-a pinkish cozy, coyly covering the toilet lid.

"I see you are not too favorably impressed," said the lady letting her hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve: she combined a cool forwardness-the overflow of what I think is cal ed "poise"-with a shyness and sadness that caused her detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as the intonation of a professor of "speech." "This is not a neat household, I confess," the doom ed ear continued, "but I assure you [she looked at my lips], you wil be very comfortable, very comfortable, indeed. Let me show you the garden" (the last more brightly, with a kind of winsome toss of the voice). Reluctantly I fol owed her downstairs again; then through the kitchen at the end of the hal , on the right side of the house-the side where also the dining room and the parlor were (under "m y" room , on the left, there was nothing but a garage). In the kitchen, the Negro maid, a plum p youngish woman, said, as she took her large glossy black purse from the knob of the door leading to the back porch: "I'l go now, Mrs. Haze." "Yes, Louise," answered Mrs. Haze with a sigh. "I'l settle with you Friday." W e passed on to a smal pantry and entered the dining room , paral el to the parlor we had already admired. I noticed a white sock on the floor. With a deprecatory grunt, Mrs. Haze stooped without stopping and threw it into a closet next to the pantry. W e cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the middle, containing nothing but the stil glistening stone of one plum . I groped for the timetable I had in my pocket and surreptitiously fished it out to look as soon as possible for a train. I was stil walking behind Mrs. Haze though the dining room when, beyond it, there cam e a sudden burst of greenery-"the piazza," sang out my leader, and then, without the least warning, a blue sea-wave swel ed under my heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun, half-naked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my Riviera love peering at me over dark glasses.

It was the same child-the same frail, honey-hued shoulders, the same silky supple bare back, the same chestnut head of hair. A polka-dotted black kerchief tied around her chest hid from my aging ape eyes, but not from the gaze of young memory, the juvenile breasts I had fondled one immortal day. And, as if I were the fairy-tale nurse of some little princess (lost, kidnapped, discovered in gypsy rags through which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds), I recognized the tiny dark-brown mole on her side. With awe and delight (the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the nurse drunk) I saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound mouth had briefly paused; and those puerile hips on which I had kissed the crenulated imprint left by the band of her shortsthat last mad immortal day behind the "Roches Roses." The twenty-five years I had lived since then, tapered to a palpitating point, and vanished.

I find it most difficult to express with adequate force that flash, that shiver, that impact of passionate recognition. In the course of the sun-shot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling child (her eyes blinking over those stern dark spectacles-the little Herr Doktor who was to cure me of al my aches) while I passed by her in my adult disguise (a great big handsome hunk of movieland manhood), the vacuum of my soul managed to suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these I checked against the features of my dead bride. A little later, of course, she, thosnouvel e, this Lolita, my Lolita, was to eclipse completely her prototype. Al I want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that "princedom by the sea" in my tortured past. Everything between the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false rudiments of joy. Everything they shared made one of them .

I have no il usions, however. M y judges wil regard al this as a piece of mummery on the part of a madman with a gross liking for the fruit vert. Au fond, Ã§a m'est bien Ã©gal. Al I now is that while the Haze woman and I went down the steps into the breathless garden, my knees were like reflections of knees in rippling water, and my lips were like sand, Page 16

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

and-"That was my Lo," she said, "and these are my lilies."

"Yes," I said, "yes. They are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful." 11

Exhibit number two is a pocket diary bound in black imitation leather, with a golden year, 1947, enescalier, in its upper left-hand corner. I speak of this neat product of the Blank Blank Co., Blankton, M ass., as if it were real y before me. Actual y, it was destroyed five years go and what we examine now (by courtesy of a photographic memory) is but its brief materialization, a puny unfledged phoenix. I remember the thing so exactly because I wrote it real y twice. First I jotted down each entry in pencil (with many erasures and corrections) on the leaves of what is commercial y known as a "typewriter tablet"; then, I copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smal est, most satanic, hand in the little black book just mentioned. M ay 30 is a Fast Day by Proclamation in New Hampshire but not in the Carolinas. That day an epidemic of "abdominal flu" (whatever that is) forced Ramsdale to close its schools for the summer. The reader may check the weather data in the Ramsdale Journal for 1947. A few days before that I moved into the Haze house, and the little diary which I now propose to reel off (much as a spy delivers by heart the contents of the note he swal owed) covers most of June.

Thursday. Very warm day. From a vantage point (bathroom window) saw Dolores taking things off a clothesline in the apple-green light behind the house. Strol ed out. She wore a plaid shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. Every movement she made in the dappled sun plucked at the most secret and sensitive chord of my abject body. After a while she sat down next to me on the lower step of the back porch and began to pick up the pebbles between her feet-pebbles, my God, then a curled bit of milk-bottle glass resembling a snarling lip-and chuck them at a can. Ping. You can't a second time-you can't hit it-oh, marvelous: tender and tanned, not the least blemish. Sundaes cause acne. The excess of the oily substance cal ed sebum which nourishes the hair fol icles of the skin creates, when too profuse, an irritation that opens the way to infection. But nymphets do not have acne although they gorge them selves on rich food. God, what agony, that silky shimmer above her temple grading into bright brown hair. And the little bone twitching at the side of her dust-powdered ankle. "The McCoo girl? Ginny McCoo? Oh, she's a fright. And mean. And lame. Nearly died of polio." Ping. The glistening tracery of down on her forearm. W hen she got up to take in the wash, I had a chance of adoring from afar the faded seat of her rol ed-up jeans. Out of the lawn, bland Mrs. Haze, complete with camera, grew up like a fakir's fake tree and after some heliotropic fussing-sad eyes up, glad eyes down-had the cheek of taking my picture as I sat blinking on the steps, Humbert le Bel.

Friday. Saw her going somewhere with a dark girl cal ed Rose. Why does the way she walks-a child, mind you, a mere child!-excite me so abominably? Analyze it. A faint suggestion of turned in toes. A kind of wiggly looseness below the knee prolonged to the end of each footfal . The ghost of a drag. Very infantile, infinitely meretricious. Humbert Humbert is also infinitely moved by the little one's slangy speech, by her harsh high voice. Later heard her vol ey crude nonsense at Rose across the fence. Twanging through me in a rising rhythm . Pause. "I must go now, kiddo." Saturday. (Beginning perhaps am ended.) I know it is madness to keep this journal but it gives me a strange thril to do so; and only a loving wife could decipher my microscopic script. Let me state with a sob that today my L. was sun-bathing on the so-cal ed

"piazza," but her mother and som e other woman were around al the time. Of course, I might have sat there in the rocker and pretended to read. Playing safe, I kept away, for I was afraid that the horrible, insane, ridiculous and pitiful trem or that palsied me might prevent me from making my entrÃ©e with any semblance of casualness. Page 17

Sunday. Heat ripple stil with us; a most favonian week. This time I took up a strategic position, with obese newspaper and new pipe, in the piazza rocker before L. arrived. To my intense disappointment she cam e with her mother, both in two-piece bathing suits, black, as new as my pipe. M y darling, my sweetheart stood for a moment near mewanted the funnies-and she smelt almost exactly like the other one, the Riviera one, but more intensely so, with rougher overtones-a torrid odor that at once set my manhood astir-but she had already yanked out of me the coveted section and retreated to her mat near her phocine mamma. There my beauty lay down on her stomach, showing me, showing the thousand eyes wide open in my eyed blood, her slightly raised shoulder blades, and the bloom along the incurvation of her spine, and the swel ings of her tense narrow nates clothed in black, and the seaside of her schoolgirl thighs. Silently, the seventh-grader enjoyed her green-red-blue comics. She was the loveliest nymphet greenredblue Priap himself could think up. As I looked on, through prismatic layers of light, dry-lipped, focusing my lust and rocking slightly under my newspaper, I felt that my perception of her, if properly concentrated upon, might be sufficient to have me attain a beggar's bliss immediately; but, like some predator that prefers a moving prey to a motionless one, I planned to have this pitiful attainment coincide with the various girlish movements she made now and then as she read, such as trying to scratch the middle of her back and revealing a stippled armpit-but fat Haze suddenly spoiled everything by turning to me and asking me for a light, and starting a make-believe conversation about a fake book by some popular fraud.

Monday. Delectatio morosa. I spend my doleful days in dumps and dolors. W e (mother Haze, Dolores and I) were to go to Our Glass Lake this afternoon, and bathe, and bask; but a nacreous morn degenerated at noon into rain, and Lo made a scene. The median age of pubescence for girls has been found to be thirteen years and nine months in New York and Chicago. The age varies for individuals from ten, or earlier, to seventeen. Virginia was not quite fourteen when Harry Edgar possessed her. He gave her lessons in algebra. Je m'imagine cela. They spent their honeymoon at Petersburg, Fla.

"Monsieur Poe-poe," as that boy in one of Monsieur Humbert Humbert's classes in Paris cal ed the poet-poet.

I have al the characteristics which, according to writers on the sex interests of children, start the responses stirring in a little girl: clean-cut jaw, muscular hand, deep sonorous voice, broad shoulder. Moreover, I am said to resemble some crooner or actor chap on whom Lo has a crush.

Tuesday. Rain. Lake of the Rains. Mamma out shopping. L., I knew, was somewhere quite near. In result of some stealthy maneuvering, I cam e across her in her mother's bedroom . Prying her left eye open to get rid of a speck of something. Checked frock. Although I do love that intoxicating brown fragrance of hers, I real y think she should wash her hair once in a while. For a moment, we were both in the same warm green bath of the mirror that reflected the top of a poplar with us in the sky. Held her roughly by the shoulders, then tenderly by the temples, and turned her about. "It's right there," she said.

"I can feel it." "Swiss peasant would use the top of her tongue." "Lick it out?" "Yeth. Shly try?" "Sure," she said. Gently I pressed my quivering sting along her rol ing salty eyebal .

"Goody-goody," she said nictating. "It is gone." "Now the other?" "You dope," she began,

"there is noth-" but here she noticed the pucker of my approaching lips.

"Okay," she said cooperatively, and bending toward her warm upturned russet face somber Humbert pressed his mouth to her fluttering eyelid. She laughed, and brushed past me out of the room . M y heart seem ed everywhere at once. Never in my life-not even when fondling my child-love in France-never-Night. Never have I experienced such agony. I would like to describe her face, her ways-and I cannot, because my own desire for her blinds me when she is near. I am not Page 18

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

used to being with nymphets, dam n it. If I close my eyes I see but an immobilized fraction of her, a cinematographic stil , a sudden smooth nether loveliness, as with one knee up under her tartan skirt she sits tying her shoe. "Dolores Haze, ne nontrez pas vos zhambes" (this is her mother who thinks she knows French). A poet Ã¡ mes heures, I com posed a madrigal to the soot-black lashes of her pale-gray vacant eyes, to the five asymmetrical freckles on her bobbed nose, to the blond down of her brown limbs; but I tore it up and cannot recal it today. Only in the tritest of terms (diary resumed) can I describe Lo's features: I might say her hair is auburn, and her lips as red as licked red candy, the lower one prettily plum p-oh, that I were a lady writer who could have her pose naked in a naked light! But instead I am lanky, big-boned, wooly-chested Humbert Humbert, with thick black eyebrows and a queer accent, and a cesspoolful of rotting monsters behind his slow boyish smile. And neither is she the fragile child of a feminine novel. W hat drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet-of every nymphet, perhaps; this mixture in my Lolita of tender dream y childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity, stemming from the snub-nosed cuteness of ads and magazine pictures, from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in the Old Country (smel ing of crushed daisies and sweat); and from very young harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels; and then again, al this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through the musk and the m ud, through the dirt and the death, oh God, oh God. And what is most singular is that she, this Lolita, my Lolita, has individualized the writer's ancient lust, so that above and over everything there is-Lolita. Wednesday. "Look, make M other take you and me to Our Glass Lake tomorrow." These were the textual words said to me by my twelve-year-old flam e in a voluptuous whisper, as we happened to bum p into one another on the front porch, I out, she in. The reflection of the afternoon sun, a dazzling white diamond with innumerable iridescent spikes quivered on the round back of a parked car. The leafage of a voluminous elm played its mel ow shadows upon the clapboard wal of the house. Two poplars shivered and shook. You could make out the formless sounds of remote traffic; a child cal ing "Nancy, Nancy!" In the house, Lolita had put on her favorite "Little Carmen" record which I used to cal "Dwarf Conductors," making her snort with mock derision at my mock wit. Thursday. Last night we sat on the piazza, the Haze woman, Lolita and I. W arm dusk had deepened into amorous darkness. The old girl had finished relating in great detail the plot of a movie she and L. had seen sometime in the winter. The boxer had fal en extremely low when he met the good old priest (who had been a boxer himself in his robust youth and could stil slug a sinner). W e sat on cushions heaped on the floor, and L. was between the woman and me (she had squeezed herself in, the pet). In my turn, I launched upon a hilarious account of my arctic adventures. The muse of invention handed me a rifle and I shot a white bear who sat down and said: Ah! Al the while I was acutely aware of L.'s nearness and as I spoke I gestured in the merciful dark and took advantage of those invisible gestures of mine to touch her hand, her shoulder and a bal erina of wool and gauze which she played with and kept sticking into my lap; and final y, when I had completely enmeshed my glowing darling in this weave of ethereal caresses, I dared stroke her bare leg along the gooseberry fuzz of her shin, and I chuckled at my own jokes, and trembled, and concealed my tremors, and once or twice felt with my rapid lips the warmth of her hair as I treated her to a quick nuzzling, humorous aside and caressed her plaything. She, too, fidgeted a good deal so that final y her mother told her sharply to quit it and sent the dol flying into the dark, and I laughed and addressed myself to Haze across Lo's legs to let my hand creep up my nymphet's thin back and feel her skin through her boy's shirt. But I knew it was al hopeless, and was sick with longing, and my clothes felt miserably Page 19

tight, and I was almost glad when her mother's quiet voice announced in the dark: "And now we al think that Lo should go to bed." "I think you stink," said Lo. "Which means there wil be no picnic tomorrow," said Haze. "This is a free country," said Lo. W hen angry Lo with a Bronx cheer had gone, I stayed on from sheer inertia, while Haze smoked her tenth cigarette of the evening and complained of Lo. She had been spiteful, if you please, at the age of one, when she used to throw her toys out of her crib so that her poor mother should keep picking them up, the vil ainous infant!

Now, at twelve, she was a regular pest, said Haze. Al she wanted from life was to be one day a strutting and prancing baton twirler or a jitterbug. Her grades were poor, but she was better adjusted in her new school than in Pisky (Pisky was the Haze home town in the Middle W est. The Ramsdale house was her late mother-in-law's. They had moved to Ramsdale less than two years ago). "Why was she unhappy there?" "Oh," said Haze,

"poor me should know, I went through that when I was a kid: boys twisting one's arm, banging into one with loads of books, pul ing one's hair, hurting one's breasts, flipping one's skirt. Of course, moodiness is a com m on concomitant of growing up, but Lo exaggerates. Sul en and evasive. Rude and defiant. Struck Viola, an Italian schoolmate, in the seat with a fountain pen. Know what I would like? If you, monsieur, happened to be stil here in the fal , I'd ask you to help her with her homework-you seem to know everything, geography, mathematics, French." "Oh, everything," answered monsieur.

"That means," said Haze quickly, "you'l be here!" I wanted to shout that I would stay on eternal y if only I could hope to caress now and then my incipient pupil. But I was wary of Haze. So I just grunted and stretched my limbs nonconcomitantly (le mot juste) and presently went up to my room . The woman, however, was evidently not prepared to cal it a day. I was already lying upon my cold bed both hands pressing to my face Lolita's fragrant ghost when I heard my indefatigable landlady creeping stealthily up to my door to whisper through it-just to make sure, she said, I was through with the Glance and Gulp magazine I had borrowed the other day. From her room Lo yel ed she had it. W e are quite a lending library in this house, thunder of God.

Friday. I wonder what my academic publishers would say if I were to quote in my textbook Ronsard's "la vermeil ette fente" or Remy Bel eau's "un petit mont feutrÃ© de mousse dÃ©licate, tracÃ© sur le milieu d'un fil et escarlatte" and so forth. I shal probably have another breakdown if I stay any longer in this house, under the strain of this intolerable temptation, by the side of my darling-m y darling-m y life and my bride. Has she already been initiated by mother nature to the Mystery of the Menarche? Bloated feelings. The Curse of the Irish. Fal ing from the roof. Grandm a is visiting. "M r. Uterus [I quote from a girls' magazine] starts to build a thick soft wal on the chance a possible baby may have to be bedded down there." The tiny madman in his padded cel . Incidental y: if I ever commit a serious murder . . . M ark the "if." The urge should be something more than the kind of thing that happened to me with Valeria. Careful y mark that then was rather inept. If and when you wish to sizzle me to death, remember that only a spel of insanity could ever give me the simple energy to be a brute (al this am ended, perhaps). Sometimes I attempt to kil in my dream s. But do you know what happens?

For instance I hold a gun. For instance I aim at a bland, quietly interested enemy. Oh, I press the trigger al right, but one bul et after another feebly drops on the floor from the sheepish muzzle. In those dream s, my only thought is to conceal the fiasco from my foe, who is slowly growing annoyed.

At dinner tonight the old cat said to me with a sidelong gleam of motherly mockery directed at Lo (I had just been describing, in a flippant vein, the delightful little toothbrush mustache I had not quite decided to grow): "Better don't if somebody is not to go absolutely dotty." Instantly Lo pushed her plate of boiled fish away, al but knocking her milk over, and bounced out of the dining room . "Would it bore you very much," Page 20

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

quoth Haze, "to com e with us tomorrow for a swim in Our Glass Lake if Lo apologizes for her manners?"

Later, I heard a great banging of doors and other sounds com ing from quaking caverns where the two rivals were having a ripping row.

She had not apologized. The lake is out. It might have been fun. Saturday. For some days already I had been leaving the door ajar, while I wrote in my room ; but only today did the trap work. With a good deal of additional fidgeting, shuffling, scraping-to disguise her embarrassment at visiting me without having been cal ed-Lo cam e in and after pottering around, became interested in the nightmare curlicues I had penned on a sheet of paper. Oh no: they were not the outcome of a bel elettrist's inspired pause between two paragraphs; they were the hideous hieroglyphics (which she could not decipher) of my fatal lust. As she bent her brown curs over the desk at which I was sitting, Humbert the Hoarse put his arm around her in a miserable imitation of blood-relationship; and stil studying, somewhat shortsightedly, the piece of paper she held, my innocent little visitor slowly sank to a half-sitting position upon my knee. Her adorable profile, parted lips, warm hair were some three inches from my bared eyetooth; and I felt the heat of her limbs through her rough tom boy clothes. Al at once I knew I could kiss her throat or the wick of her mouth with perfect impunity. I knew she would let me do so, and even close her eyes as Hol ywood teaches. A double vanil a with hot fudge-hardly more unusual than that. I cannot tel my learned reader (whose eyebrows, I suspect, have by now traveled al the way to the back of his bald head), I cannot tel him how the knowledge cam e to me; perhaps my ape-ear had unconsciously caught some slight change in the rhythm of her respiration-for now she was not real y looking at my scribble, but waiting with curiosity and composure-oh, my limpid nymphet!-for the glamorous lodger to do what he was dying to do. A modern child, an avid reader of movie magazines, an expert in dream slow close-ups, might not think it too strange, I guessed, if a handsome, intensely virile grown-up friend-too late. The house was suddenly vibrating with voluble Louise's voice tel ing Mrs. Haze who had just com e home about a dead something she and Leslie Tom son had found in the basement, and little Lolita was not one to miss such a tale. Sunday. Changeful, bad-tempered, cheerful, awkward, graceful with the tart grace of her coltish subteens, excruciatingly desirable from head to foot (al New England for a ladywriter's pen!), from the black read-made bow and bobby pins holding her hair in place to the little scar on the lower part of her neat calf (where a rol er-skater kicked her in Pisky), a couple of inches above her rough white sock. Gone with her mother to the Hamiltons-a birthday party or something. Ful -skirted gingham frock. Her little doves seem wel formed already. Precocious pet!

Monday. Rainy morning. "Ces matins gris si doux . . ." M y white pajamas have a lilac design on the back. I am like one of those inflated pale spiders you see in old gardens. Sitting in the middle of a luminous web and giving little jerks to this or that strand. M y web is spread al over the house as I listen from my chair where I sit like a wily wizard. Is Lo in her room ? Gently I tug on the silk. She is not. Just heard the toilet paper cylinder make its staccato sound as it is turned; and no footfal s has my outflung filament traced from the bathroom back to her room . Is she stil brushing her teeth (the only sanitary act Lo performs with real zest)? No. The bathroom door has just slammed, so one has to feel elsewhere about the house for the beautiful warm-colored prey. Let us have a strand of silk descend the stairs. I satisfy myself by this means that she is not in the kitchen-not banging the refrigerator door or screeching at her detested mamma (who, I suppose, is enjoying her third, cooing and subduedly mirthful, telephone conversation of the morning). W el , let us grope and hope. Ray-like, I glide in through to the parlor and find the radio silent (and mamma stil talking to Mrs. Chatfield or Mrs. Hamilton, very softly, Page 21

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

flushed, smiling, cupping the telephone with her free hand, denying by implication that she denies those am using rum ors, rum or, roomer, whispering intimately, as she never does, the clear-cut lady, in face to face talk). So my nymphet is not in the house at al !

Gone! W hat I thought was a prismatic weave turns out to be but an old gray cobweb, the house is empty, is dead. And then comes Lolita's soft sweet chuckle through my halfopen door "Don't tel M other but I've eaten al your bacon." Gone when I scuttle out of my room

. Lolita, where are you? M y breakfast tray, lovingly prepared by my landlady, leers at me toothlessly, ready to be taken in. Lola, Lolita!

Tuesday. Clouds again interfered with that picnic on that unattainable lake. Is it Fate scheming? Yesterday I tried on before the mirror a new pair of bathing trunks. Wednesday. In the afternoon, Haze (com m on-sensical shoes, tailor-made dress), said she was driving downtown to buy a present for a friend of a friend of hers, and would I please com e too because I have such a wonderful taste in textures and perfumes.

"Choose your favorite seduction," she purred. W hat could Humbert, being in the perfume business, do?

She had me cornered between the front porch and her car. "Hurry up," she said as I laboriously doubled up my large body in order to crawl in (stil desperately devising a means of escape). She had started the engine, and was genteel y swearing at a backing and turning truck in front that had just brought old invalid Miss Opposite a brand new wheel chair, when my Lolita's sharp voice cam e from the parlor window: "You! W here are you going? I'm coming too! Wait!" "Ignore her," yelped Haze (kil ing the motor); alas for my fair driver; Lo was already pul ing at the door on my side. "This is intolerable," began Haze; but Lo had scram bled in, shivering with glee. "Move your bottom , you," said Lo. "Lo!" cried Haze (sideglancing at me, hoping I would throw rude Lo out). "And behold," said Lo (not for the first time), as she jerked back, as I jerked back, as the car leapt forward. "It is intolerable," said Haze, violently getting into second, "that a child should be so il -mannered. And so very persevering. W hen she knows she is unwanted. And needs a bath."

M y knuckles lay against the child's blue jeans. She was barefooted; her toenails showed remnants of cherry-red polish and there was a bit of adhesive tape across her big toe; and, God, what would I not have given to kiss then and there those delicate-boned, longtoed, monkeyish feet! Suddenly her hand slipped into mine and without our chaperon's seeing, I held, and stroked, and squeezed that little hot paw, al the way to the store. The wings of the diver's Marlenesque nose shone, having shed or burned up their ration of powder, and she kept up an elegant monologue anent the local traffic, and smiled in profile, and pouted in profile, and beat her painted lashes in profile, while I prayed we would never get to that store, but we did.

I have nothing else to report, save, primo: that big Haze had little Haze sit behind on our way home, and secundo: that the lady decided to keep Humbert's Choice for the backs of her own shapely ears.

Thursday. W e are paying with hail and gale for the tropical beginning of the month. In a volume of the Young People's Encyclopedia, I found a map of the states that a child's pencil had started copying out on a sheet of lightweight paper, upon the other side of which, counter to the unfinished outline of Florida and the Gulf, there was a mimeographed list of names referring, evidently, to her class at the Ramsdale school. It is a poem I know already by heart.

A poem , a poem , forsooth! So strange and sweet was it to discover this "Haze, Dolores" (she!) in its special bower of names, with its bodyguard of roses-a fairy princess between her two maids of honor. I am trying to analyze the spine-thril of delight it gives me, this name among al those others. W hat is it that excites me almost to tears (hot, opalescent, thick tears that poets and lovers shed)? W hat is it? The tender anonymity of this name with its formal veil ("Dolores") and that abstract transposition of first name and surname, which is like a pair of new pale gloves or a mask? Is "m ask" the keyword? Is it because there is always delight in the semitranslucent mystery, the flowing charshaf, through which the flesh and the eye you alone are elected to know smile in passing at you alone? Or is it because I can imagine so wel the rest of the colorful classroom around my dolorous and hazy darling: Grace and her ripe pimples; Ginny and her lagging leg; Gordon, the haggard masturbator; Duncan, the foul-smel ing clown; nailbiting Agnes; Viola, of the blackheads and the bouncing bust; pretty Rosaline; dark Mary Rose; adorable Stel a, who has let strangers touch her; Ralph, who bul ies and steals; Irving, for whom I am sorry. And there she is there, lost in the middle, gnawing a pencil, detested by teachers, al the boys' eyes on her hair and neck, my Lolita. Friday. I long for some terrific disaster. Earthquake. Spectacular explosion. Her mother is Page 23

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

messily but instantly and permanently eliminated, along with everybody else for miles around. Lolita whimpers in my arms. A free man, I enjoy her among the ruins. Her surprise, my explanations, demonstrations, ul ulations. Idle and idiotic fancies! A brave Humbert would have played with her most disgustingly (yesterday, for instance, when she was again in my room to show me her drawings, school-artware); he might have bribed her-and got away with it. A simpler and more practical fel ow would have soberly stuck to various commercial substitutes-if you know where to go, I don't. Despite my many looks, I am horribly timid. My romantic soul gets al clammy and shivery at the thought of running into some awful indecent unpleasantness. Those ribald sea monsters. "Mais al ez-y, al ez-y!" Annabel skipping on one foot to get into her shorts, I seasick with rage, trying to screen her.

Sam e date, later, quite late. I have turned on the light to take down a dream . It had an evident antecedent. Haze at dinner had benevolently proclaimed that since the weather bureau promised a sunny weekend we would go to the lake Sunday after church. As I lay in bed, erotical y musing before trying to go to sleep, I thought of a final scheme how to profit by the picnic to com e. I was aware that mother Haze hated my darling for her being sweet on me. So I planned my lake day with a view to satisfying the mother. To her alone would I talk; but at some appropriate moment I would say I had left my wrist watch or my sunglasses in that glade yonder-and plunge with my nymphet into the wood. Reality at this juncture withdrew, and the Quest for the Glasses turned into a quiet little orgy with a singularly knowing, cheerful, corrupt and com pliant Lolita behaving as reason knew she could not possibly behave. At 3 a.m. I swal owed a sleeping pil , and presently, a dream that was not a sequel but a parody revealed to me, with a kind of meaningful clarity, the lake I had never yet visited: it was glazed over with a sheet of emerald ice, and a pockmarked Eskimo was trying in vain to break it with a pickax, although imported mimosas and oleanders flowered on its gravel y banks. I am sure Dr. Blanche Schwarzmann would have paid me a sack of schil ings for adding such a libidream to her files. Unfortunately, the rest of it was frankly eclectic. Big Haze and little Haze rode on horseback around the lake, and I rode too, dutiful y bobbing up and down, bowlegs astraddle although there was no horse between them , only elastic air-one of those little omissions due to the absentmindedness of the dream agent.

Saturday. M y heart is stil thumping. I stil squirm and emit low moans of remembered embarrassment.

Dorsal view. Glimpse of shiny skin between T-shirt and white gym shorts. Bending, over a window sil , in the act of tearing off leaves from a poplar outside while engrossed in torrential talk with a newspaper boy below (Kenneth Knight, I suspect) who had just propel ed the Ramsdale Journal with a very precise thud onto the porch. I began creeping up to her-"crippling" up to her as pantomimists say. M y arms and legs were convex surfaces between which-rather than upon which-I slowly progressed by some neutral means of locomotion: Humbert the Wounded Spider. I must have taken hours to reach her: I seem ed to see her through the wrong end of a telescope, and toward her taut little rear I moved like some paralytic, on soft distorted limbs, in terrible concentration. At last I was right behind her when I had the unfortunate idea of blustering a trifle-shaking her by the scruff of the neck and that sort of thing to cover my real manÃ©ge, and she said in a shril brief whine: "Cut it out!"-most coarsely, the little wench, and with a ghastly grin Humbert the Humble beat a gloom y retreat while she went on wisecracking streetward. But now listen to what happened next. After lunch I was reclining in a low chair trying to read. Suddenly two deft little hands were over my eyes: she had crept up from behind as if re-enacting, in a bal et sequence, my morning maneuver. Her fingers were a luminous crimson as they tried to blot out the sun, and she uttered hiccups of laughter and jerked this way and that as I stretched my arm sideways and backwards without otherwise Page 24

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

changing my recumbent position. My hand swept over her agile giggling legs, and the book like a sleigh left my lap, and Mrs. Haze strol ed up and said indulgently: "Just slap her hard if she interferes with your scholarly meditations. How I love this garden [no exclamation mark in her tone]. Isn't it divine in the sun [no question mark either]." And with a sign of feigned content, the obnoxious lady sank down on the grass and looked up at the sky as she leaned back on her splayed-out hands, and presently an old gray tennis bal bounced over her, and Lo's voice cam e from the house haughtily: "Pardonnez, M

other. I was not aiming at you." Of course not, my hot downy darling. This proved to be the last of twenty entries or so. It wil be seem from them that for al the devil's inventiveness, the scheme remained daily the same. First he would tem pt me-and then thwart me, leaving me with a dul pain in the very root of my being. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and how to do it, without impinging on a child's chastity; after al , I had had some experience in my life of pederosis; had visual y possessed dappled nymphets in parks; had wedged my wary and bestial way into the hottest, most crowded corner of a city bus ful of straphanging school children. But for almost three weeks I had been interrupted in al my pathetic machinations. The agent of these interruptions was usual y the Haze woman (who, as the reader wil mark, was more afraid of Lo's deriving some pleasure from me than of my enjoying Lo). The passion I had developed for that nymphetfor the first nymphet in my life that could be reached at last by my awkward, aching, timid claws-would have certainly landed me again in a sanatorium , had not the devil realized that I was to be granted some relief if he wanted to have me as a plaything for some time longer.

The reader has also marked the curious Mirage of the Lake. It would have been logical on the part of Aubrey McFate (as I would like to dub that devil of mine) to arrange a smal treat for me on the promised beach, in the presumed forest. Actual y, the promise M rs. Haze had made was a fraudulent one: she had not told me that Mary Rose Hamilton (a dark little beauty in her own right) was to com e too, and that the two nymphets would be whispering apart, and playing apart, and having a good time al by them selves, while Mrs. Haze and her handsome lodger conversed sedately in the seminude, far from prying eyes. Incidental y, eyes did pry and tongues did wag. How queer life is! W e hasten to alienate the very fates we intended to woo. Before my actual arrival, my landlady had planned to have an old spinster, a Miss Phalen, whose mother had been cook in Mrs. Haze's family, com e to stay in the house with Lolita and me, while Mrs. Haze, a career girl at heart, sought some suitable job in the nearest city. Mrs. Haze had seen the whole situation very clearly: the bespectacled, round-backed Herr Humbert coming with his Central-European trunks to gather dust in his corner behind a heap of old books; the unloved ugly little daughter firmly supervised by Miss Phalen who had already once had my Lo under her buzzard wing (Lo recal ed that 1944 summer with an indignant shudder); and Mrs. Haze herself engaged as a receptionist in a great elegant city. But a not too complicated event interfered with that program. Miss Phalen broke her hip in Savannah, Ga., on the very day I arrived in Ramsdale.

The Sunday after the Saturday already described proved to be as bright as the weatherman had predicted. W hen putting the breakfast things back on the chair outside my room for my good landlady to remove at her convenience, I gleaned the fol owing situation by listening from the landing across which I had softly crept to the banisters in my old bedroom slippers-the only old things about me.

There had been another row. Mrs. Hamilton had telephoned that her daughter "was running a temperature." Mrs. Haze informed her daughter that the picnic would have to be postponed. Hot little Haze informed big cold Haze that, if so, she would not go with her to church. M other said very wel and left.

I had com e out on the landing straight after shaving, soapy-earlobed, stil in my white Page 25

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

pajam as with the cornflower blue (not the lilac) design on the back; I now wiped off the soap, perfumed my hair and armpits, slipped on a purple silk dressing gown, and, humming nervously, went down the stairs in quest of Lo.

I want my learned readers to participate in the scene I am about to replay; I want them to examine its every detail and see for them selves how careful, how chaste, the whole winesweet event is if viewed with what my lawyer has cal ed, in a private talk we have had,

"impartial sympathy." So let us get started. I have a difficult job before me. Main character: Humbert the Hummer. Time: Sunday morning in June. Place: sunlit living room

. Props: old, candy-striped davenport, magazines, phonograph, Mexican knickknacks (the late M r. Harold E. Haze-God bless the good m an-had engendered my darling at the siesta hour in a blue-washed room , on a honeymoon trip to Vera Cruz, and mementoes, among these Dolores, were al over the place). She wore that day a pretty print dress that I had seen on her once before, ample in the skirt, tight in the bodice, short-sleeved, pink, checkered with darker pink, and, to complete the color scheme, she had painted her lips and was holding in her hol owed hands a beautiful, banal, Eden-red apple. She was not shod, however, for church. And her white Sunday purse lay discarded near the phonograph.

M y heart beat like a drum as she sat down, cool skirt bal ooning, subsiding, on the sofa next to me, and played with her glossy fruit. She tossed it up into the sun-dusted air, and caught it-it made a cupped polished plot.

Humbert Humbert intercepted the apple.

"Give it back," - she pleaded, showing the marbled flush of her palms. I produced Delicious. She grasped it and bit into it, and my heart was like snow under thin crimson skin, and with the nonkeyish nimbleness that was so typical of that American nymphet, she snatched out of my abstract grip the magazine I had opened (pity no film had recorded the curious pattern, the monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or overlapping moves). Rapidly, hardly ham pered by the disfigured apple she held, Lo flipped violently through the pages in search of something she wished Humbert to see. Found it at last. I faked interest by bringing my head so close that her hair touched my temple and her arm brushed my cheek as she wiped her lips with her wrist. Because of the burnished mist through which I peered at the picture, I was slow in reacting to it, and her bare knees rubbed and knocked impatiently against each other. Dimly there cam e into view: a surrealist painter relaxing, supine, on a beach, and near him, likewise supine, a plaster replica of the Venus di Milo, half-buried in sand. Picture of the W eek, said the legend. I whisked the whole obscene thing away. Next moment, in a sham effort to retrieve it, she was al over me. Caught her by her thin knobby wrist. The magazine escaped to the floor like a flustered fowl. She twisted herself free, recoiled, and lay back in the right-hand corner of the davenport. Then, with perfect simplicity, the impudent child extended her legs across my lap.

By this time I was in a state of excitement bordering on insanity; but I also had the cunning of the insane. Sitting there, on the sofa, I managed to attune, by a series of stealthy movements, my masked lust to her guileless limbs. It was no easy matter to divert the little maiden's attention while I performed the obscure adjustments necessary for the success of the trick. Talking fast, lagging behind my own breath, catching up with it, mimicking a sudden toothache to explain the breaks in my patter-and al the while keeping a maniac's inner eye on my distant golden goal, I cautiously increased the magic friction that was doing away, in an il usional, if not factual, sense, with the physical y irremovable, but psychological y very friable texture of the material divide (pajamas and robe) between the weight of two sunburnt legs, resting athwart my lap, and the hidden tum or of an unspeakable passion. Having, in the course of my patter, hit upon something nicely mechanical, I recited, garbling them slightly, the words of a foolish song that was Page 26

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

then popular-O my Carmen, my little Carmen, something, something, those something nights, and the stars, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen; I kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spel (spel because of the garbling), and al the while I was mortal y afraid that some act of God might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which al my being seem ed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment. The stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and the bars, and the barmen, were presently taken over by her; her voice stole and corrected the tune I had been mutilating. She was musical and apple-sweet. Her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap; I stroked them ; there she lol ed in the right-hand corner, almost asprawl, Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice, losing her slipper, rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet, against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofa-and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beautybetween my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. Under my glancing finger tips I felt the minute hairs bristle ever so slightly along her shins. I lost myself in the pungent but healthy heat which like summer haze hung about little Haze. Let her stay, let her stay . . . As she strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the fender, her young weight, her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom , shifted in my tense, tortured, surreptitiously laboring lap; and al of a sudden a mysterious change cam e over my senses. I entered a plane of being where nothing mattered, save the infusion of joy brewed within my body. W hat had begun as a delicious distention of my innermost roots became a glowing tingle which now had reached that state of absolute security, confidence and reliance not found elsewhere in conscious life. With the deep hot sweetness thus established and wel on its way to the ultimate convulsion, I felt I could slow down in order to prolong the glow. Lolita had been safely solipsized. The implied sun pulsated in the supplied poplars; we were fantastical y and divinely alone; I watched her, rosy, gold-dusted, beyond the veil of my control ed delight, unaware of it, alien to it, and the sun was on her lips, and her lips were apparently stil forming the words of the Carmen-barmen ditty that no longer reached my consciousness. Everything was now ready. The nerves of pleasure had been laid bare. The corpuscles of Krause were entering the phase of frenzy. The least pressure would suffice to set al paradise loose. I had ceased to be Humbert the Hound, the sad-eyed degenerate cur clasping the boot that would presently kick him away. I was above the tribulations of ridicule, beyond the possibilities of retribution. In my self-made seraglio, I was a radiant and robust Turk, deliberately, in the ful consciousness of his freedom , postponing the moment of actual y enjoying the youngest and frailest of his slaves. Suspended on the brink of that voluptuous abyss (a nicety of physiological equipoise com parable to certain techniques in the arts) I kept repeating the chance words after her-barmen, alarmin', my charmin', my carmen, ahmen, ahahamen-as one talking and laughing in his sleep while my happy hand crept up her sunny leg as far as the shadow of decency al owed. The day before she had col ided with the heavy chest in the hal and"Look, look!"-I gasped-"look what you've done, what you've done to yourself, ah, look"; for there was, I swear, a yel owish-violet bruise on her lovely nymphet thigh which my huge hairy hand massaged and slowly enveloped-and because of her very perfunctory underthings, there seem ed to be nothing to prevent my muscular thumb from reaching the hot hol ow of her groin-just as you might tickle and caress a giggling child-just thatand: "Oh, it's nothing at al ," she cried with a sudden shril note in her voice, and she wiggled, and squirmed, and threw her head back, and her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as she half-turned away, and my moaning mouth, gentlemen of the jury, almost reached her bare neck, Page 27

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

while I crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known.

Immediately afterward (as if we had been struggling and now my grip had eased) she rol ed off the sofa and jumped to her feet-to her foot, rather-in order to attend to the formidably loud telephone that may have been ringing for ages as far as I was concerned. There she stood and blinked, cheeks aflame, hair awry, her eyes passing over me as lightly as they did over the furniture, and as she listened or spoke (to her mother who was tel ing her to com e to lunch with her at the Chatfileds-neither Lo nor Hum knew yet what busybody Haze was plotting), she kept tapping the edge of the table with the slipper she held in her hand. Blessed be the Lord, she had noticed nothing!

With a handkerchief of multicolored silk, on which her listening eyes rested in passing, I wiped the sweat off my forehead, and, immersed in a euphoria of release, rearranged my royal robes. She was stil at the telephone, haggling with her mother (wanted to be fetched by car, my little Carmen) when, singing louder and louder, I swept up the stairs and set a deluge of steaming water roaring into the tub.

At this point I may as wel give the words of that song hit in ful -to the best of my recol ection at least-I don't think I ever had it right. Here goes: O my Carmen, my little Carmen!

Something, something those something nights,

And the stars, and the cars, and the bars and the barmen-And, O my charmin', our dreadful fights. And the something town where so gaily, arm in

Arm, we went, and our final row,

And the gun I kil ed you with, O my Carmen,

The gun I am holding now.

(Drew his .32 automatic, I guess, and put a bul et through his mol 's eye.) I had lunch in town-had not been so hungry for years. The house was stil Lo-less when I strol ed back. I spent the afternoon musing, scheming, blissful y digesting my experience of the morning. I felt proud of myself. I had stolen the honey of a spasm without impairing the morals of a minor. Absolutely no harm done. The conjurer had poured milk, molasses, foam ing champagne into a young lady's new white purse; and lo, the purse was intact. Thus had I delicately constructed my ignoble, ardent, sinful dream ; and stil Lolita was safe-and I was safe. W hat I had madly possessed was not she, but my own creation, another, fanciful Lolita-perhaps, more real than Lolita; overlapping, encasing her; floating between me and her, and having no wil , no consciousness-indeed, no life of her own. The child knew nothing. I had done nothing to her. And nothing prevented me from repeating a performance that affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and I a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark. The afternoon drifted on and on, in ripe silence, and the sappy tal trees seem ed to be in the know; and desire, even stronger than before, began to afflict me again. Let her com e soon, I prayed, addressing a loan God, and while mamma is in the kitchen, let a repetition of the davenport scene be staged, please, I adore her so horribly. No: "horribly" is the wrong word. The elation with which the vision of new delights fil ed me was not horrible but pathetic. I qualify it as pathetic. Pathetic-because despite the insatiable fire of my venereal appetite, I intended, with the most fervent force and foresight, to protect the purity of that twelve-year-old child. And now see how I was repaid for my pains. No Lolita came home-she had gone with the Chatfields to a movie. The table was laid with more elegance than usual: candlelight, if you please. In this mawkish aura, Mrs. Haze gently touched the silver on both sides of her plate as if touching piano keys, and smiled down on her empty plate (was on a diet), Page 28

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

and said she hoped I liked the salad (recipe lifted from a woman's magazine). She hoped I liked the cold cuts, too. It had been a perfect day. Mrs. Chatfield was a lovely person. Phyl is, her daughter, was going to a summer cam p tomorrow. For three weeks. Lolita, it was decided, would go Thursday. Instead of waiting til July, as had been initial y planned. And stay there after Phyl is had left. Til school began. A pretty prospect, my heart.

Oh, how I was taken aback-for did it not mean I was losing my darling, just when I had secretly made her mine? To explain my grim mood, I had to use the same toothache I had already simulated in the morning. Must have been an enormous molar, with an abscess as big as a maraschino cherry.

"We have," said Haze, "an excel ent dentist. Our neighbor, in fact. Dr. Quilty. Uncle or cousin, I think, of the playwright. Think it wil pass? W el , just as you wish. In the fal I shal have him 'brace' her, as my mother used to say. It may curb Lo a little. I am afraid she has been bothering you frightful y al these days. And we are in for a couple of stormy ones before she goes. She has flatly refused to go, and I confess I left her with the Chatfields because I dreaded to face her alone just yet. The movie may mol ify her. Phyl is is a very sweet girl, and there is no earthly reason for Lo to dislike her. Real y, monsieur, I am very sorry about that tooth of yours. It would be so much more reasonable to let me contact Ivor Quilty first thing tomorrow morning if it stil hurts. And, you know, I think a summer cam p is so much healthier, and-wel , it is al so much more reasonable as I say than to mope on a suburban lawn and use mamma's lipstick, and pursue shy studious gentlemen, and go into tantrum s at the least provocation."

"Are you sure," I said at last, "that she wil be happy there?" (lame, lamentably lam e!)

"She'd better," said Haze. "And it won't be al play either. The cam p is run by Shirley Holmes-you know, the woman who wrote Campfire Girl. Cam p wil teach Dolores Haze to grow in many things-health, knowledge, tem per. And particularly in a sense of responsibility towards other people. Shal we take these candles with us and sit for a while on the piazza, or do you want to go to bed and nurse that tooth?" Nurse that tooth. Next day they drove downtown to buy things needed for the cam p: any wearable purchase worked wonders with Lo. She seemed her usual sarcastic self at dinner. Immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at Camp Q (they were so thoroughly sampled by Thursday that she left them behind). I too retired to my lair, and wrote letters. M y plan now was to leave for the seaside and then, when school began, resume my existence in the Haze household; for I knew already that I could not live without the child. On Tuesday they went shopping again, and I was asked to answer the phone if the cam p mistress rang up during their absence. She did; and a month or so later we had occasion to recal our pleasant chat. That Tuesday, Lo had her dinner in her room. She had been crying after a routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions, had not wished me to see her swol en eyes: she had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get al blurred and inflamed, and morbidly al uring. I regretted keenly her mistake about my private aesthetics, for I simply love that tinge of Botticel ian pink, that raw rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes; and, natural y, her bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation. There was, however, more to it than I thought. As we sat in the darkness of the verandah (a rude wind had put out her red candles), Haze, with a dreary laugh, said she had told Lo that her beloved Humbert thoroughly approved of the whole cam p idea "and now," added Haze, "the child throws a fit; pretext: you and I want to get rid of her; actual reason: I told her we would exchange tomorrow for plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she bul ied me into buying for her. You see, she sees herself as a starlet; I see her as a sturdy, healthy, but Page 29

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

decidedly homely kid. This, I guess, is at the root of our troubles." On Wednesday I managed to waylay Lo for a few seconds: she was on the landing, in sweatshirt and green-stained white shorts, rummaging in a trunk. I said something meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort without looking at me. Desperate, dying Humbert patted her clumsily on her coccyx, and she struck him, quite painful y, with one of the late M r. Haze's shoetrees. "Doublecrosser," she said as I crawled downstairs rubbing my arm with a great show of rue. She did not condescend to have dinner with Hum and mum: washed her hair and went to bed with her ridiculous books. And on Thursday quiet Mrs. Haze drove her to Cam p Q.

As greater authors than I have put it: "Let readers imagine" etc. On second thought, I may as wel give those imaginations a kick in the pants. I knew I had fal en in love with Lolita forever; but I also knew she would not be forever Lolita. She would be thirteen on January 1. In two years or so she would cease being a nymphet and would turn into a

"young girl," and then, into a "col ege girl"-that horror of horrors. The word "forever" referred only to my own passion, to the eternal Lolita as reflected in my blood. The Lolita whose iliac crests had not yet flared, the Lolita that today I could touch and smel and hear and see, the Lolita of the strident voice and rich brown hair-of the bangs and the swirls and the sides and the curls at the back, and the sticky hot neck, and the vulgar vocabulary-"revolting," "super," "luscious," "goon," "drip"-that Lolita, my Lolita, poor Catul us would lose forever. So how could I afford not to see her for two months of summer insomnias? Two whole months out of the two years of her remaining nymphage!

Should I disguise myself as a somber old-fashioned girl, gawky Ml e Humbert, and put up my tent on the outskirts of Cam p Q, in the hope that its russet nymphets would clam or:

"Let us adopt that deep-voiced D.P.," and drag the said, shyly smiling Berthe au Grand Pied to their rustic hearth. Berthe wil sleep with Dolores Haze!

Idle dry dreams. Two months of beauty, two months of tenderness, would be squandered forever, and I could do nothing about it, but nothing, mais rien. One drop of rare honey, however, that Thursday did hold in its acorn cup. Haze was to drive her to the cam p in the early morning. Upon sundry sounds of departure reaching me, I rol ed out of bed and leaned out of the window. Under the poplars, the car was already athrob. On the sidewalk, Louise stood shading her eyes with her hand, as if the little traveler were already riding into the low morning sun. The gesture proved to be premature. "Hurry up!" shouted Haze. M y Lolita, who was half in and about to slam the car door, wind down the glass, wave to Louise and the poplars (whom and which she was never to see again), interrupted the motion of fate: she looked up-and dashed back into the house (Haze furiously cal ing after her). A moment later I heard my sweetheart running up the stairs. M

y heart expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out. I hitched up the pants of my pajamas, flung the door open: and simultaneously Lolita arrived, in her Sunday frock, stamping, panting, and then she was in my arms, her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws, my palpitating darling! The next instant I heart heralive, unraped-clatter downstairs. The motion of fate was resumed. The blond leg was pul ed in, the car door was slammed-was reslam m ed-and driver Haze at the violent wheel, rubber-red lips writhing in angry, inaudible speech, swung my darling away, while unnoticed by them or Louise, old M iss Opposite, an invalid, feebly but rhythmical y waved from her vined verandah. 16

The hol ow of my hand was stil ivory-ful of Lolita-ful of the feel of her preadolescently incurved back, that ivory-smooth, sliding sensation of her skin through the thin frock that I had worked up and down while I held her. I marched into her tum bled room , threw open the door of the closet, and plunged into a heap of crumpled things that had touched her. There was particularly one pink texture, sleazy, torn, with a faintly acrid Page 30

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

odor in the seam . I wrapped in it Humbert's huge engorged heart. A poignant chaos was wel ing within m e-but I had to drop those things and hurriedly regain my composure, as I became aware of the maid's velvety voice cal ing me softly from the stairs. She had a message for me, she said; and, topping my automatic thanks with a kindly "you're welcom e," good Louise left an unstamped, curiously clean-looking letter in my shaking hand.

"This is a confession. I love you [so the letter began; and for a distorted moment I mistook its hysterical scrawl for a schoolgirl's scribble]. Last Sunday in church-bad you, who refused to com e to see our beautiful new windows!-only last Sunday, my dear one, when I asked the Lord what to do about it, I was told to act as I am acting now. You see, there is no alternative. I have loved you from the minute I saw you. I am a passionate and lonely woman and you are the love of my life.

Now, my dearest, dearest, m on cher, cher m onsieur, you have read this; now you know. So, wil you please, at once, pack and leave. This is a landlady's order. I am dism issing a lodger. I am kicking you out. Go! Scram ! Departez! I shal be back by dinnertime, if I do eighty both ways and don't have an accident (but what would it matter?), and I do not wish to find you in the house. Please, please, leave at once, now, do not even read this absurd note to the end. Go. Adieu.

The situation, chÃ©ri, is quite simple. Of course, I know with absolute certainty that I am nothing to you, nothing at al to you, nothing at al . Oh yes, you enjoy talking to me (and kidding poor me), you have grown fond of our friendly house, of the books I like, of my lovely garden, even of Lo's noisy ways-but I am nothing to you. Right? Right. Nothing to you whatever. But if, after reading my "confession," you decided, in your dark rom antic European way, that I am attractive enough for you to take advantage of my letter and make a pass at me, then you would be a criminal-worse than a kidnaper who rapes a child. You see, chÃ©ri. If you decided to stay, if I found you at hom e (which I know I won'tand that's why I am able to go on like this), the fact of your rem aining would only m ean one thing: that you want me as much as I do you: as a lifelong mate; and that you are ready to link up your life with mine forever and ever and be a father to my little girl. Let me rave and ram ble on for a teeny while more, my dearest, since I know this letter has been by now torn by you, and its pieces (il egible) in the vortex of the toilet. M y dearest, m on trÃ©s, trÃ©s cher, what a world of love I have built up for you during this miraculous June! I know how reserved you are, how "British." Your old-world reticence, your sense of decorum may be shocked by the boldness of an American girl! You who conceal your strongest feelings must think me a sham eless little idiot for throwing open my poor bruised heart like this. In years gone by, many disappointments cam e my way. M r. Haze was a splendid person, a sterling soul, but he happened to be twenty years my senior, and-wel , let us not gossip about the past. M y dearest, your curiosity must be wel satisfied if you have ignored my request and read this letter to the bitter end. Never mind. Destroy it and go. Do not forget to leave the key on the desk in your room . And som e scrap of address so that I could refund the twelve dol ars I owe you til the end of the m onth. Good-bye, dear one. Pray for me-if you ever pray. C.H."

W hat I present here is what I rem em ber of the letter, and what I rem em ber of the letter I rem em ber verbatim (including that awful French). It was at least twice longer. I have left out a lyrical passage which I more or less skipped at the time, concerning Lolita's brother who died at 2 when she was 4, and how much I would have liked him. Let me see what else can I say? Yes. There is just a chance that "the vortex of the toilet" (where the letter did go) is my own matter-of-fact contribution. She probably begged me to make a special fire to consum e it.

Page 31

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

M y first m ovem ent was one of repulsion and retreat. M y second was like a friend's calm hand fal ing upon my shoulder and bidding me take my time. I did. I cam e out of my daze and found myself stil in Lo's room . A ful -page ad ripped out of a slick magazine was affixed to the wal above the bed, between a crooner's mug and the lashes of a m ovie actress. It represented a dark-haired young husband with a kind of drained look in his Irish eyes. He was m odeling a robe by So-and-So and holding a bridgelike tray by Soand-So, with breakfast for two. The legend, by the Rev. Thom as M orel , cal ed him a

"conquering hero." The thoroughly conquered lady (not shown) was presum ably propping herself up to receive her half of the tray. How her bed-fel ow was to get under the bridge without som e m essy mishap was not clear. Lo had drawn a jocose arrow to the haggard lover's face and had put, in block letters: H.H. And indeed, despite a difference of a few years, the resem blance was striking. Under this was another picture, also a colored ad. A distinguished playwright was solem nly sm oking a Drom e. He always sm oked Drom es. The resem blance was slight. Under this was Lo's chase bed, littered with "com ics." The enam el had com e off the bedstead, leaving black, more or less rounded, marks on the white. Having convinced myself that Louise had left, I got into Lo's bed and reread the letter.

17

Gentlem en of the jury! I cannot swear that certain motions pertaining to the business in hand-if I may coin an expression-had not drifted across my mind before. M y mind had not retained them in any logical form or in any relation to definitely recol ected occasions; but I cannot swear-let me repeat-that I had not toyed with them (to rig up yet another expression), in my dim ness of thought, in my darkness of passion. There may have been times-there must have been times, if I know my Humbert-when I had brought up for detached inspection the idea of marrying a mature widow (say, Charlotte Haze) with not one relative left in the wide gray world, merely in order to have my way with her child (Lo, Lola, Lolita). I am even prepared to tel my tormentors that perhaps once or twice I had cast an appraiser's cold eye at Charlotte's coral lips and bronze hair and dangerously low neckline, and had vaguely tried to fit her into a plausible daydream . This I confess under torture. Imaginary torture, perhaps, but al the more horrible. I wish I might digress and tel you more of the pavor nocturnus that would rack me at night hideously after a chance term had struck me in the random readings of my boyhood, such as peine forte et dure (what a Genius of Pain must have invented that!) or the dreadful, mysterious, insidious words "traum a," "traum atic event," and "transom ." But my tale is sufficiently incondite already.

After a while I destroyed the letter and went to my room , and rum inated, and rum pled my hair, and m odeled my purple robe, and m oaned through clenched teeth and suddenly-Suddenly, gentlem en of the jury, I felt a Dostoevskian grin dawning (through the very grim ace that twisted my lips) like a distant and terrible sun. I imagined (under conditions of new and perfect visibility) al the casual caresses her mother's husband would be able to lavish on his Lolita. I would hold her against me three times a day, every day. Al my troubles would be expel ed, I would be a healthy man. "To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee and print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss . . ." W el -read Humbert!

Then, with al possible caution, on mental tiptoe so to speak, I conjured up Charlotte as a possible mate. By God, I could make myself bring her that econom ical y halved grapefruit, that sugarless breakfast.

Humbert Humbert sweating in the fierce white light, and howled at, and trodden upon by sweating policem en, is now ready to make a further "statem ent" (quel mot!) as he turns his conscience inside out and rips off its innermost lining. I did not plan to marry poor Charlotte in order to eliminate her in som e vulgar, gruesom e and dangerous m anner such as kil ing her by placing five bichloride-of-mercury tablets in her preprandial sherry or Page 32

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

anything like that; but a delicately al ied, pharm acopoeial thought did tinkle in my sonorous and clouded brain. W hy limit myself to the m odest masked caress I had tried already? Other visions of venery presented them selves to me swaying and sm iling. I saw myself adm inistering a powerful sleeping potion to both mother and daughter so as to fondle the latter though the night with perfect im punity. The house was ful of Charlotte's snore, while Lolita hardly breathed in her sleep, as stil as a painted girl-child.

"M other, I swear Kenny never even touched me." "You either lie, Dolores Haze, or it was an incubus." No, I would not go that far.

So Humbert the Cubus schem ed and dream ed-and the red sun of desire and decision (the two things that create a live world) rose higher and higher, while upon a succession of balconies a succession of libertines, sparkling glass in hand, toasted the bliss of past and future nights. Then, figuratively speaking, I shattered the glass, and boldly imagined (for I was drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature) how eventual y I might blackm ail-no, that it too strong a word-m auvem ail big Haze into letting me consort with the little Haze by gently threatening the poor doting Big Dove with desertion if she tried to bar me from playing with my legal stepdaughter. In a word, before such an Amazing Offer, before such a vastness and variety of vistas, I was as helpless as Adam at the preview of early oriental history, miraged in his apple orchard. And now take down the fol owing im portant rem ark: the artist in me has been given the upper hand over the gentlem an. It is with a great effort of wil that in this memoir I have m anaged to tune my style to the tone of the journal that I kept when M rs. Haze was to me but an obstacle. That journal of mine is no more; but I have considered it my artistic duty to preserve its intonations no matter how false and brutal they may seem to me now. Fortunately, my story has reached a point where I can cease insulting poor Charlotte for the sake of retrospective verisimilitude.

W ishing to spare poor Charlotte two or three hours of suspense on a winding road (and avoid, perhaps, a head-on col ision that would shatter our different dream s), I made a thoughtful but abortive attem pt to reach her at the cam p by telephone. She had left half an hour before, and getting Lo instead, I told her-trem bling and brimming with my mastery over fate-that I was going to marry her mother. I had to repeat it twice because som ething was preventing her from giving me her attention. "Gee, that's swel ," she said laughing. "W hen is the wedding? Hold on a sec, the pup-That put here has got hold of my sock. Listen-" and she added she guessed she was going to have loads of fun . . . and I realized as I hung up that a couple of hours at that cam p had been sufficient to blot out with new impressions the image of handsom e Humbert Humbert from little Lolita's mind. But what did it matter now? I would get her back as soon as a decent am ount of time after the wedding had elapsed. "The orange blossom would have scarcely withered on the grave," as a poet might have said. But I am no poet. I am only a very conscientious recorder.

After Louise had gone, I inspected the icebox, and finding it much too puritanic, walked to town and bought the richest foods available. I also bought som e good liquor and two or three kinds of vitam ins. I was pretty sure that with the aid of these stimulants and my natural resources, I would avert any em barrassm ent that my indifference might incur when cal ed upon to display a strong and impatient flam e. Again and again resourceful Humbert evoked Charlotte as seen in the raree-show of a manly imagination. She was wel groom ed and shapely, this I could say for her, and she was my Lolita's big sister-this notion, perhaps, I could keep up if only I did not visualize too realistical y her heavy hips, round knees, ripe bust, the coarse pink skin of her neck ("coarse" by com parison with silk and honey) and al the rest of that sorry and dul thing: a handsom e woman. The sun made its usual round of the house as the afternoon ripened into evening. I had a drink. And another. And yet another. Gin and pineapple juice, my favorite mixture, Page 33

always double my energy. I decided to busy myself with our unkem pt lawn. Une petite attention. It was crowded with dandelions, and a cursed dog-I loathe dogs-had defiled the flat stones where a sundial had once stood. M ost of the dandelions had changed from suns to m oons. The gin and Lolita were dancing in me, and I almost fel over the folding chairs that I attem pted to dislodge. Incarnadine zebras! There are som e eructations that sound like cheers-at least, mine did. An old fence at the back of the garden separated us from the neighbor's garbage receptacles and lilacs; but there was nothing between the front end of our lawn (where it sloped along one side of the house) and the street. Therefore I was able to watch (with the sm irk of one about to perform a good action) for the return of Charlotte: that tooth should be extracted at once. As I lurched and lunged with the hand mower, bits of grass optical y twittering in the low sun, I kept an eye on that section of suburban street. It curved in from under an archway of huge shade trees, then sped towards us down, down, quite sharply, past old M iss Opposite's ivied brick house and high-sloping lawn (much trimmer than ours) and disappeared behind our own front porch which I could not see from where I happily belched and labored. The dandelions perished. A reek of sap mingled with the pineapple. Two little girls, M arion and M abel, whose com ings and goings I had m echanical y fol owed of late (but who could replace my Lolita?) went toward the avenue (from which our Lawn Street cascaded), one pushing a bicycle, the other feeding from a paper bag, both talking at the top of their sunny voices. Leslie, old M iss Opposite's gardener and chauffeur, a very am iable and athletic Negro, grinned at me from afar and shouted, reshouted, commented by gesture, that I was mighty energetic today. The fool dog of the prosperous junk dealer next door ran after a blue car-not Charlotte's. The prettier of the two little girls (M abel, I think), shorts, halter with little to halt, bright hair-a nym phet, by Pan!-ran back down the street crum pling her paper bag and was hidden from this Green Goat by the frontage of M r. And M rs. Humbert's residence. A station wagon popped out of the leafy shade of the avenue, dragging som e of it on its roof before the shadows snapped, and swung by at an idiotic pace, the sweatshirted driver roof-holding with his left hand and the junkm an's dog tearing alongside. There was a sm iling pause-and then, with a flutter in my breast, I witnessed the return of the Blue Sedan. I saw it glide downhil and disappear behind the corner of the house. I had a glimpse of her calm pale profile. It occurred to me that until she went upstairs she would not know whether I had gone or not. A minute later, with an expression of great anguish on her face, she looked down at me from the window of Lo's room . By sprinting upstairs, I m anaged to reach that room before she left it. 18

W hen the bride is a window and the groom is a widower; when the former has lived in Our Great Little Town for hardly two years, and the latter for hardly a m onth; when M

onsieur wants to get the whole dam ned thing over with as quickly as possible, and M

adame gives in with a tolerant sm ile; then, my reader, the wedding is general y a

"quiet" affair. The bride may dispense with a tiara of orange blossom s securing her finger-tip veil, nor does she carry a white orchid in a prayer book. The bride's little daughter might have added to the cerem onies uniting H. and H. a touch of vivid vermeil; but I knew I would not dare be too tender with cornered Lolita yet, and therefore agreed it was not worth while tearing the child away from her beloved Cam p Q. M y soi-disant passionate and lonely Charlotte was in everyday life matter-of-fact and gregarious. M

oreover, I discovered that although she could not control her heart or her cries, she was a woman of principle. Immediately after she had becom e more or less my mistress (despite the stimulants, her "nervous, eager chÃ©ri-a heroic chÃ©ri!-had som e initial trouble, for which, however, he am ply com pensated her by a fantastic display of oldworld endearments), good Charlotte interviewed me about my relations with God. I could have answered that on that score my mind was open; I said, instead-paying my Page 34

tribute to a pious platitude-that I believed in a cosm ic spirit. Looking down at her fingernails, she also asked me had I not in my fam ily a certain strange strain. I countered by inquiring whether she would stil want to marry me if my father's maternal grandfather had been, say, a Turk. She said it did not matter a bit; but that, if she ever found out I did not believe in Our Christian God, she would commit suicide. She said it so solem nly that it gave me the creeps. It was then I knew she was a woman of principle. Oh, she was very genteel: she said "excuse me" whenever a slight burp interrupted her flowing speech, cal ed an envelope and ahnvelope, and when talking to her lady-friends referred to me as M r. Humbert. I thought it would please her if I entered the com m unity trailing som e glam our after me. On the day of our wedding a little interview with me appeared in the Society Colum n of the Ram sdale Journal, with a photograph of Charlotte, one eyebrow up and a misprint in her nam e ("Hazer"). Despite this contretem pts, the publicity warmed the porcelain cockles of her heart-and made my rattles shake with awful glee. by engaging in church work as wel as by getting to know the better mothers of Lo's schoolmates, Charlotte in the course of twenty m onths or so had m anaged to becom e if not a prom inent, at least an acceptable citizen, but never before had she com e under that thril ing rubrique, and it was I who put her there, M r. Edgar H. Humbert (I threw in the "Edgar" just for the heck of it), "writer and explorer." M cCoo's brother, when taking it down, asked me what I had written. W hatever I told him cam e out as

"several books on Peacock, Rainbow and other poets." It was also noted that Charlotte and I had known each other for several years and that I was a distant relation of her first husband. I hinted I had had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in print. To Charlotte I said that society colum ns should contain a shimmer of errors.

Let us go on with this curious tale. W hen cal ed upon to enjoy my prom otion from lodger to lover, did I experience only bitterness and distaste? No. M r. Humbert confesses to a certain titil ation of his vanity, to som e faint tenderness, even to a pattern of rem orse daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger. Never had I thought that the rather ridiculous, through rather handsom e M rs. Haze, with her blind faith in the wisdom of her church and book club, her m annerism s of elocution, her harsh, cold, contem ptuous attitude toward an adorable, downy-armed child of twelve, could turn into such a touching, helpless creature as soon as I laid my hands upon her which happened on the threshold of Lolita's room whither she trem ulously backed repeating "no, no, please no." The transformation improved her looks. Her sm ile that had been such a contrived thing, thenceforth becam e the radiance of utter adoration-a radiance having som ething soft and moist about it, in which, with wonder, I recognized a resem blance to the lovely, inane, lost look that Lo had when gloating over a new kind of concoction at the soda fountain or mutely adm iring my expensive, always tailor-fresh clothes. Deeply fascinated, I would watch Charlotte while she swapped parental woes with som e other lady and made that national grim ace of fem inine resignation (eyes rol ing up, m outh drooping sideways) which, in an infantile form, I had seen Lo making herself. W e had highbal s before turning in, and with their help, I would manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother. This was the white stom ach within which my nym phet had been a little curved fish in 1934. This careful y dyed hair, so sterile to my sense of sm el and touch, acquired at certain lam plit moments in the poster bed the tinge, if not the texture, of Lolita's curls. I kept tel ing myself, as I wielded my brand-new large-as-life wife, that biological y this was the nearest I could get to Lolita; that at Lolita's age, Lotte had been as desirable a schoolgirl as her daughter was, and as Lolita's daughter would be som e day. I had my wife unearth from under a col ection of shoes (M r. Haze had a passion for them , it appears) a thirty-year-old album , so that I might see how Lotte had looked as a child; and even though the light was wrong and the dresses graceless, I was able to make Page 35

out a dim first version of Lolita's outline, legs, cheekbones, bobbed nose. Lottelita, Lolitchen.

So I tom -peeped across the hedges of years, into wan little windows. And when, by m eans of pitiful y ardent, naively lascivious caresses, she of the noble nipple and m assive thigh prepared me for the perform ance of my nightly duty, it was stil a nym phet's scent that in despair I tried to pick up, as I bayed through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests.

I simply can't tel you how gentle, how touching my poor wife was. At breakfast, in the depressingly bright kitchen, with its chrom e glitter and Hardware and Co. Calendar and cute breakfast nook (simulating that Coffee Shoppe where in their col ege days Charlotte and Humbert used to coo together), she would sit, robed in red, her elbow on the plastictopped table, her cheek propped on her fist, and stare at me with intolerable tenderness as I consum ed my ham and eggs. Humbert's face might twitch with neuralgia, but in her eyes it vied in beauty and animation with the sun and shadows of leaves rippling on the white refrigerator. M y solem n exasperation was to her the silence of love. M y sm al incom e added to her even sm al er one impressed her as a bril iant fortune; not because the resulting sum now sufficed for most middle-class needs, but because even my m oney shone in her eyes with the magic of my manliness, and she saw our joint account as one of those southern boulevards at midday that have solid shade on one side and sm ooth sunshine on the other, al the way to the end of a prospect, where pink m ountains loom . Into the fifty days of our cohabitation Charlotte crammed the activities of as many years. The poor woman busied herself with a num ber of things she had foregone long before or had never been much interested in, as if (to prolong these Proustian intonations) by my marrying the mother of the child I loved I had enabled my wife to regain an abundance of youth by proxy. W ith the zest of a banal young bride, she started to "glorify the hom e." Knowing as I did its every cranny by heartsince those days when from my chair I mental y m apped out Lolita's course through the house-I had long entered into a sort of em otional relationship with it, with its very ugliness and dirt, and now I could almost feel the wretched thing cower in its reluctance to endure the bath of ecru and ocher and puttbuffand-snuff that Charlotte planned to give it. She never got as far as that, thank God, but she did use up a trem endous am ount of energy in washing window shades, waxing the slats of Venetian blinds, purchasing new shades and new blinds, returning them to the store, replacing them by others, and so on, in a constant chiaroscuro of sm iles and frowns, doubts and pouts. She dabbled in cretonnes and chintzes; she changed the colors of the sofa-the sacred sofa where a bubble of paradise had once burst in slow motion within me. She rearranged the furniture-and was pleased when she found, in a household treatise, that "it is permissible to separate a pair of sofa com m odes and their com panion lam ps." W ith the authoress of Your Home Is You, she developed a hatred for little lean chairs and spindle tables. She believed that a room having a generous expanse of glass, and lots of rich wood paneling was an exam ple of the masculine type of room , whereas the fem inine type was characterized by lighter-looking windows and frailer woodwork. The novels I had found her reading when I m oved in were now replaced by il ustrated catalogues and hom em aking guides. From a firm located at 4640 Roosevelt Blvd., Philadelphia, she ordered for our double bed a "dam ask covered 312 coil mattress"-although the old one seem ed to me resilient and durable enough for whatever it had to support. A Midwesterner, as her late husband had also been, she had lived in coy Ram sdale, the gem of an eastern state, not long enough to know al the nice people. She knew slightly the jovial dentist who lived in a kind of ram shackle wooden chateau behind our lawn. She had met at a church tea the "snooty" wife of the local junk dealer who owned the

"colonial" white horror at the corner of the avenue. Now and then she "visited with" old Page 36

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

M iss Opposite; but the more patrician matrons am ong those she cal ed upon, or met at lawn functions, or had telephone chats with-such dainty ladies as M rs. Glave, M rs. Sheridan, M rs. M cCrystal, M rs. Knight and others, seldom seem ed to cal on my neglected Charlotte. Indeed, the only couple with whom she had relations of real cordiality, devoid of any arriÃ©re-pensÃ©e or practical foresight, were the Farlows who had just com e back from a business trip to Chile in time to attend our wedding, with the Chatfields, M cCoos, and a few others (but not M rs. Junk or the even prouder M rs. Talbot). John Farlow was a middle-aged, quiet, quietly athletic, quietly successful dealer in sporting goods, who had an office at Parkington, forty miles away: it was he who got me the cartridges for that Colt and showed me how to use it, during a walk in the woods one Sunday; he was also what he cal ed with a sm ile a part-time lawyer and had handled som e of Charlotte's affairs. Jean, his youngish wife (and first cousin), was a long-limbed girl in harlequin glasses with two boxer dogs, two pointed breasts and a big red m outh. She painted-landscapes and portraits-and vividly do I rem em ber praising, over cocktails, the picture she had made of a niece of hers, little Rosaline Honeck, a rosy honey in a Girl Scout uniform, beret of green worsted, belt of green webbing, charming shoulder-long curls-and John rem oved his pipe and said it was a pity Dol y (my Dolita) and Rosaline were so critical of each other at school, but he hoped, and we al hoped, they would get on better when they returned from their respective cam ps. W e talked of the school. It had its drawbacks, and it had its virtues. "Of course, too many of the tradespeople here are Italians," said John, "but on the other hand we are stil spared-" "I wish," interrupted Jean with a laugh, "Dol y and Rosaline were spending the summer together." Suddenly I imagined Lo returning from cam p-brown, warm, drowsy, druggedand was ready to weep with passion and impatience. 19

A few words more about M rs. Humbert while the going is good (a bad accident is to happen quite soon). I had been always aware of the possessive streak in her, but I never thought she would be so crazily jealous of anything in my life that had not been she. She showed a fierce insatiable curiosity for my past. She desired me to resuscitate al my loves so that she might make me insult them , and tram ple upon them , and revoke them apostately and total y, thus destroying my past. She made me tel her about my marriage to Valeria, who was of course a scream ; but I also had to invent, or to pad atrociously, a long series of mistresses for Charlotte's morbid delectation. To keep her happy, I had to present her with an il ustrated catalogue of them , al nicely differentiated, according to the rules of those American ads where schoolchildren are pictured in a subtle ratio of races, with one-only one, but as cute as they make them - chocolate-colored round-eyed little lad, almost in the very middle of the front row. So I presented my women, and had them sm ile and sway-the languorous blond, the fiery brunette, the sensual copperheadas if on parade in a bordel o. The more popular and platitudinous I made them , the more M rs. Humbert was pleased with the show.

Never in my life had I confessed so much or received so many confessions. The sincerity and artlessness with which she discussed what she cal ed her "love-life," from first necking to connubial catch-as-catch-can, were, ethical y, in striking contrast with my glib com positions, but technical y the two sets were congeneric since both were affected by the sam e stuff (soap operas, psychoanalysis and cheap novelettes) upon which I drew for my characters and she for her m ode of expression. I was considerably am used by certain rem arkable sexual habits that the good Harold Haze had had according to Charlotte who thought my mirth improper; but otherwise her autobiography was as devoid of interests as her autopsy would have been. I never saw a healthier woman than she, despite thinning diets.

Of my Lolita she seldom spoke-m ore seldom , in fact, than she did of the blurred, blond Page 37

male baby whose photograph to the exclusion of al others adorned our bleak bedroom . In once of her tasteless reveries, she predicted that the dead infant's soul would return to earth in the form of the child she would bear in her present wedlock. And although I felt no special urge to supply the Humbert line with a replica of Harold's production (Lolita, with an incestuous thril , I had grown to regard as my child), it occurred to me that a prolonged confinem ent, with a nice Cesarean operation and other com plications in a safe maternity ward som etime next spring, would give me a chance to be alone with my Lolita for weeks, perhaps-and gorge the limp nym phet with sleeping pil s. Oh, she simply hated her daughter! W hat I thought especial y vicious was that she had gone out of her way to answer with great diligence the questionnaires in a fool's book she had (A guide to Your Child's Developm ent), published in Chicago. The rigm arole went year by year, and M om was supposed to fil out a kind of inventory at each of her child's birthdays. On Lo's twelfth, January 1, 1947, Charlotte Haze, nÃ©e Becker, had underlined the fol owing epithets, ten out of forty, under "Your Child's Personality": aggressive, boisterous, critical, distrustful, impatient, irritable, inquisitive, listless, negativistic (underlined twice) and obstinate. She had ignored the thirty rem aining adjectives, am ong which were cheerful, co-operative, energetic, and so forth. It was real y m addening. W ith a brutality that otherwise never appeared in my loving wife's mild nature, she attacked and routed such of Lo's little belongings that had wandered to various parts of the house to freeze there like so many hypnotized bunnies. Little did the good lady dream that one morning when an upset stom ach (the result of my trying to improve on her sauces) had prevented me from accom panying her to church, I deceived her with one of Lolita's anklets. And then, her attitude toward my saporous darling's letters!

"Dear M ummy and Hummy,

Hope you are fine. Thank you very much for the candy. I [crossed out and re-written again] I lost my new sweater in the woods. It has been cold here for the last few days. I'm having a time. Love,

Dol y."

"The dum b child," said M rs. Humbert, "has left out a word before 'time.' That sweater was al -wool, and I wish you would not send her candy without consulting me." 20

There was a woodlake (Hourglass Lake-not as I had thought it was spel ed) a few miles from Ram sdale, and there was one week of great heat at the end of July when we drove there daily. I am now obliged to describe in som e tedious detail our last swim there together, one tropical Tuesday morning.

W e had left the car in a parking area not far from the road and were making our way down a path cut through the pine forest to the lake, when Charlotte rem arked that Jean Farlow, in quest of rare light effects (Jean belonged to the old school of painting), had seen Leslie taking a dip "in the ebony" (as John had quipped) at five o'clock in the morning last Sunday.

"The water," I said, "m ust have been quite cold."

"That is not the point," said the logical doom ed dear. "He is subnormal, you see. And," she continued (in that careful y phrased way of hers that was beginning to tel on my health), "I have a very definite feeling our Louise is in love with that moron." Feeling. "W e feel Dol y is not doing as wel " etc. (from an old school report). The Humberts walked on, sandaled and robed.

"Do you know, Hum: I have one most am bitious dream ," pronounced Lady Hum, lowering her head-shy of that dream - and com m uning with the tawny ground. "I would love to get hold of a real trained servant maid like that German girl the Talbots spoke of; and have her live in the house."

"No room ," I said.

Page 38

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"Com e," she said with her quizzical sm ile, "surely, chÃ©ri, you underestimate the possibilities of the Humbert hom e. W e would put her in Lo's room . I intended to make a guestroom of that hole anyway. It's the coldest and m eanest in the whole house."

"W hat are you talking about?" I asked, the skin of my cheekbones tensing up (this I take the trouble to note only because my daughter's skin did the sam e when she felt that way: disbelief, disgust, irritation).

"Are you bothered by Rom antic Associations?" queried my wife-in al usion to her first surrender.

"Hel no," said I. "I just wonder where wil you put your daughter when you get your guest or your maid."

"Ah," said M rs. Humbert, dream ing, sm iling, drawing out the "Ah" simultaneously with the raise of one eyebrow and a soft exhalation of breath. "Little Lo, I'm afraid, does not enter the picture at al , at al . Little Lo goes straight from cam p to a good boarding school with strict discipline and som e sound religious training. And then-Beardsley Col ege. I have it al m apped out, you need not worry."

She went on to say that she, M rs. Humbert, would have to overcom e her habitual sloth and write to M iss Phal i's sister who taught at St. Algebra. The dazzling lake em erged. I said I had forgotten my sunglasses in the car and would catch up with her. I had always thought that wringing one's hands was a fictional gesture-the obscure outcom e, perhaps, of som e medieval ritual; but as I took to the woods, for a spel of despair and desperate meditation, this was the gesture ("look, Lord, at these chains!") that would have com e nearest to the mute expression of my m ood.

Had Charlotte been Valeria, I would have known how to handle the situation; and

"handle" is the word I want. In the good old days, by merely twisting fat Valechka's brittle wrist (the one she had fal en upon from a bicycle) I could make her change her mind instantly; but anything of the sort in regard to Charlotte was unthinkable. Bland American Charlotte frightened me. M y lighthearted dream of control ing her through her passion for me was al wrong. I dared not do anything to spoil the image of me she had set up to adore. I had toadied to her when she was the awesom e duenna of my darling, and a groveling som ething stil persisted in my attitude toward her. The only ace I held was her ignorance of my m onstrous love for her Lo. She had been annoyed by Lo's liking me; but my feelings she could not divine. To Valeria I might have said: "Look here, you fat fool, c'est moi qui dÃ©cide what is good for Dolores Humbert." To Charlotte, I could not even say (with ingratiating calm): "Excuse me, my dear, I disagree. Let us give the child one more chance. Let me be her private tutor for a year or so. You once told me yourself-" In fact, I could not say anything at al to Charlotte about the child without giving myself away. Oh, you cannot imagine (as I had never imagined) what these women of principle are!

Charlotte, who did not notice the falsity of al the everyday conventions and rules of behavior, and foods, and books, and people she doted upon, would distinguish at once a false intonation in anything I might say with a view to keeping Lo near. She was like a musician who may be an odious vulgarian in ordinary life, devoid of tact and taste; but who wil hear a false note in music with diabolical accuracy of judgm ent. To break Charlotte's wil , I would have to break her heart. If I broke her heart, her image of me would break too. If I said: "Either I have my way with Lolita, and you help me to keep the matter quiet, or we part at once," she would have turned as pale as a woman of clouded glass and slowly replied: "Al right, whatever you add or retract, this is the end." And the end it would be. Such, then, was the m ess. I rem em ber reaching the parking area and pum ping a handful of rust-tasting water, and drinking it as avidly as if it would give me magic wisdom , youth, freedom , a tiny concubine. For a while, purple-robed, heeldangling, I sat on the edge of one of the rude tables, under the whooshing pines. In the middle distance, two Page 39

little maidens in shorts and halters cam e out of a sun-dappled privy marked "W om en." Gum-chewing M abel (or M abel's understudy) laboriously, absentmindedly straddled a bicycle, and M arion, shaking her hair because of the flies, settled behind, legs wide apart; and wobbling, they slowly, absently, merged with the light and shade. Lolita! Father and daughter melting into these woods! The natural solution was to destroy M rs. Humbert. But how?

No man can bring about the perfect murder; chance, however, can do it. There was the fam ous dispatch of a M me Lacour in Arles, southern France, at the close of last century. An unidentified bearded six-footer, who, it was later conjectured, had been the lady's secret lover, walked up to her in a crowded street, soon after her marriage to Colonel Lacour, and mortal y stabbed her in the back, three times, while the Colonel, a sm al bul dog of a man, hung onto the murderer's arm. By a miraculous and beautiful coincidence, right at the moment when the operator was in the act of loosening the angry little husband's jaws (while several onlookers were closing in upon the group), a cranky Italian in the house nearest to the scene set off by sheer accident som e kind of explosive he was tinkering with, and immediately the street was turned into a pandem onium of sm oke, fal ing bricks and running people. The explosion hurt no one (except that it knocked out gam e Colonel Lacour); but the lady's vengeful lover ran when the others ran-and lived happily ever after.

Now look what happens when the operator himself plans a perfect rem oval. I walked down to Hourglass Lake. The spot from which we and a few other "nice" couples (the Farlows, the Chatfields) bathed was a kind of sm al cove; my Charlotte liked it because it was almost "a private beach." The main bathing facilities (or drowning facilities" as the Ram sdale Journal had had occasion to say) were in the left (eastern) part of the hourglass, and could not be seen from our covelet. To our right, the pines soon gave way to a curve of marshland which turned again into forest on the opposite side. I sat down beside my wife so noiselessly that she started.

"Shal we go in?" she asked.

"W e shal in a minute. Let me fol ow a train of thought." I thought. M ore than a minute passed.

"Al right. Com e on."

"W as I on that train?"

"You certainly were."

"I hope so," said Charlotte entering the water. It soon reached the gooseflesh of her thick thighs; and then, joining her outstretched hands, shutting her m outh tight, very plainfaced in her black rubber headgear, charlotte flung herself forward with a great splash. Slowly we swam out into the shimmer of the lake.

On the opposite bank, at least a thousand paces away (if one cold walk across water), I could make out the tiny figures of two men working like beavers on their stretch of shore. I knew exactly who they were: a retired policem an of Polish descent and the retired plum ber who owned most of the timber on that side of the lake. And I also knew they were engaged in building, just for the dism al fun of the thing, a wharf. The knocks that reached us seem ed so much bigger than what could be distinguished of those dwarfs'

arms and tools; indeed, one suspected the director of those acrosonic effects to have been at odds with the puppet-master, especial y since the hefty crack of each diminutive blow lagged behind its visual version.

The short white-sand strip of "our" beach-from which by now we had gone a little way to reach deep water-was em pty on weekday mornings. There was nobody around except those two tiny very busy figures on the opposite side, and a dark-red private plane that droned overhead, and then disappeared in the blue. The setting was real y perfect for a brisk bubbling murder, and here was the subtle point: the man of law and the man of Page 40

water were just near enough to witness an accident and just far enough not to observe a crime. They were near enough to hear a distracted bather thrashing about and bel owing for som ebody to com e and help him save his drowning wife; and they were too far to distinguish (if they happened to look too soon) that the anything but distracted swimmer was finishing to tread his wife underfoot. I was not yet at that stage; I merely want to convey the ease of the act, the nicety of the setting! So there was Charlotte swimming on with dutiful awkwardness (she was a very mediocre mermaid), but not without a certain solem n pleasure (for was not her merman by her side?); and as I watched, with the stark lucidity of a future recol ection (you know-trying to see things as you wil rem em ber having seen them ), the glossy whiteness of her wet face so little tanned despite al her endeavors, and her pale lips, and her naked convex forehead, and the tight black cap, and the plum p wet neck, I knew that al I had to do was to drop back, take a deep breath, then grab her by the ankle and rapidly dive with my captive corpse. I say corpse because surprise, panic and inexperience would cause her to inhale at once a lethal gal on of lake, while I would be able to hold on for at least a ful minute, open-eyed under water. The fatal gesture passed like the tail of a fal ing star across the blackness of the contem plated crime. It was like som e dreadful silent bal et, the male dancer holding the bal erina by her foot and streaking down through watery twilight. I might com e up for a m outhful of air while stil holding her down, and then would dive again as many times as would be necessary, and only when the curtain cam e down on her for good, would I permit myself to yel for help. And when som e twenty minutes later the two puppets steadily growing arrived in a rowboat, one half newly painted, poor M rs. Humbert Humbert, the victim of a cram p or coronary occlusion, or both, would be standing on her head in the inky ooze, som e thirty feet below the sm iling surface of Hourglass Lake. Simple, was it not? But what d'ye know, folks-I just could not make myself do it!

She swam beside me, a trustful and clum sy seal, and al the logic of passion scream ed in my ear: Now is the time! And, folks, I just couldn't! In silence I turned shoreward and gravely, dutiful y, she also turned, and stil hel scream ed its counsel, and stil I could not make myself drown the poor, slippery, big-bodied creature. The scream grew more and more rem ote as I realized the melancholy fact that neither tom orrow, nor Friday, nor any other day or night, could I make myself put her to death. Oh, I could visualize myself slapping Valeria's breasts out of alignm ent, or otherwise hurting her-and I could see myself, no less clearly, shooting her lover in the underbel y and making him say "akh!" and sit down. But I could not kil Charlotte-especial y when things were on the whole not quite as hopeless, perhaps, as they seem ed at first wince on that miserable morning. W

ere I to catch her by her strong kicking foot; were I to see her am azed look, hear her awful voice; were I stil to go through with the ordeal, her ghost would haunt me al my life. Perhaps if the year were 1447 instead of 1947 I might have hoodwinked my gentle nature by adm inistering her som e classical poison from a hol ow agate, som e tender philter of death. But in our middle-class nosy era it would not have com e off the way it used to in the brocaded palaces of the past. Nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a kil er. No, no, I was neither. Ladies and gentlem en of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for som e throbbing, sweet-moaning, physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girl-child, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the com m unity to al ow them to pursue their practical y harmless, so-cal ed aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them . W e are not sex fiends! W e do not rape as good soldiers do. W e are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlem en, sufficiently wel integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nym phet. Em phatical y, no kil ers are we. Poets never kil . Oh, my poor Charlotte, do not hate me in your eternal heaven am ong an Page 41

eternal alchem y of asphalt and rubber and metal and stone-but thank God, not water, not water!

Nonetheless it was a very close shave, speaking quite objectively. And now com es the point of my perfect-crime parable.

W e sat down on our towels in the thirsty sun. She looked around, loosened her bra, and turned over on her stom ach to give her back a chance to be feasted upon. She said she loved me. She sighed deeply. She extended one arm and groped in the pocket of her robe for her cigarettes. She sat up and sm oked. She exam ined her right shoulder. She kissed me heavily with open sm oky m outh. Suddenly, down the sand bank behind us, from under the bushes and pines, a stone rol ed, then another.

"Those disgusting prying kids," said Charlotte, holding up her big bra to her breast and turning prone again. "I shal have to speak about that to Peter Krestovski." From the debouchm ent of the trail cam e a rustle, a footfal , and Jean Farlow marched down with her easel and things.

"You scared us," said Charlotte.

Jean said she had been up there, in a place of green concealment, spying on nature (spies are general y shot), trying to finish a lakescape, but it was no good, she had no talent whatever (which was quite true)-"And have you ever tried painting, Humbert?" Charlotte, who was a little jealous of Jean, wanted to know if John was com ing. He was. He was com ing hom e for lunch today. He had dropped her on the way to Parkington and should be picking her up any time now. It was a grand morning. She always felt a traitor to Caval and M elam pus for leaving them roped on such gorgeous days. She sat down on the white sand between Charlotte and me. She wore shorts. Her long brown legs were about as attractive to me as those of a chestnut mare. She showed her gum s when she sm iled.

"I almost put both of you into my lake," she said. "I even noticed som ething you overlooked. You [addressing Humbert] had your wrist watch on in, yes, sir, you had."

"W aterproof," said Charlotte softly, making a fish m outh. Jean took my wrist upon her knee and exam ined Charlotte's gift, then put back Humbert's hand on the sand, palm up.

"You could see anything that way," rem arked Charlotte coquettishly. Jean sighed. "I once saw," she said, "two children, male and fem ale, at sunset, right here, making love. Their shadows were giants. And I told you about M r. Tom son at daybreak. Next time I expect to see fat old Ivor in the ivory. He is real y a freak, that man. Last time he told me a com pletely indecent story about his nephew. It appears-"

"Hul o there," said John's voice.

21

M y habit of being silent when displeased or, more exactly, the cold and scaly quality of my displeased silence, used to frighten Valeria out of her wits. She used to whimper and wail, saying "Ce qui me rend fol e, c'est que je ne sais Ã¡ quoi tu penses quand tu es comme Ã§a." I tried being silent with Charlotte-and she just chirped on, or chucked my silence under the chin. An astonishing woman! I would retire to my former room , now a regular "studio," mumbling I had after al a learned opus to write, and cheerful y Charlotte went on beautifying the hom e, warbling on the telephone and writing letters. From my window, through the lacquered shiver of poplar leaves, I could see her crossing the street and contentedly mailing her letter to M iss Phalen's sister. The week of scattered showers and shadows which elapsed after our last visit to the motionless sands of Hourglass Lake was one of the gloom iest I can recal . Then cam e two or three dim rays of hope-before the ultimate sunburst.

It occurred to me that I had a fine brain in beautiful working order and that I might as wel use it. If I dared not m eddle with my wife's plans for her daughter (getting warmer Page 42

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

and browner every day in the fair weather of hopeless distance), I could surely devise som e general m eans to assert myself in a general way that might be later directed toward a particular occasion. One evening, Charlotte herself provided me with an opening.

"I have a surprise for you," she said looking at me with fond eyes over a spoonful of soup. "In the fal we two are going to England."

I swal owed my spoonful, wiped my lips with pink paper (Oh, the cool rich linens of M

irana Hotel!) and said:

"I have also a surprise for you, my dear. W e two are not going to England."

"W hy, what's the matter?" she said, looking-with more surprise than I had counted uponat my hands (I was involuntarily folding and tearing and crushing and tearing again the innocent pink napkin). M y sm iling face set her som ewhat at ease, however.

"The matter is quite simple," I replied. "Even in the most harm onious of households, as ours is, not al decisions are taken by the fem ale partner. There are certain things that the husband is there to decide. I can wel imagine the thril that you, a healthy American gal, must experience at crossing the Atlantic on the sam e ocean liner with Lady Bum ble-or Sam Bum ble, the Frozen M eat King, or a Hol ywood harlot. And I doubt not that you and I would make a pretty ad for the Traveling Agency when portrayed looking-you, frankly starry-eyed, I, control ing my envious adm iration-at the Palace Sentries, or Scarlet Guards, or Beaver Eaters, or whatever they are cal ed. But I happen to be al ergic to Europe, including merry old England. As you wel know, I have nothing but very sad associations with the Old and rotting W orld. No colored ads in your magazines wil change the situation."

"M y darling," said Charlotte. "I real y-"

"No, wait a minute. The present matter is only incidental. I am concerned with a general trend. W hen you wanted me to spend my afternoons sunbathing on the Lake instead of doing my work, I gladly gave in and becam e a bronzed glam our boy for your sake, instead of rem aining a scholar and, wel , an educator. W hen you lead me to bridge and bourbon with the charming Farlows, I m eekly fol ow. No, please, wait. W hen you decorate your hom e, I do not interfere with your schem es. W hen you decide-when you decide al kinds of matters, I may be in com plete, or in partial, let us say, disagreem entbut I say nothing. I ignore the particular. I cannot ignore the general. I love being bossed by you, but every gam e has its rules. I am not cross. I am not cross at al . Don't do that. But I am one half of this household, and have a sm al but distinct voice." She had com e to my side and had fal en on her knees and was slowly, but very vehem ently, shaking her head and clawing at my trousers. She said she had never realized. She said I was her ruler and her god. She said Louise had gone, and let us make love right away. She said I must forgive her or she would die. This little incident fil ed me with considerable elation. I told her quietly that it was a matter not of asking forgiveness, but of changing one's ways; and I resolved to press my advantage and spend a good deal of time, aloof and m oody, working at my book-or at least pretending to work.

The "studio bed" in my former room had long been converted into the sofa it had always been at heart, and Charlotte had warned me since the very beginning of our cohabitation that gradual y the room would be turned into a regular "writer's den." A couple of days after the British Incident, I was sitting in a new and very com fortable easy chair, with a large volum e in my lap, when Charlotte rapped with her ring finger and sauntered in. How different were her m ovem ents from those of my Lolita, when she used to visit me in her dear dirty blue jeans, sm el ing of orchards in nym phetland; awkward and fey, and dimly depraved, the lower buttons of her shirt unfastened. Let me tel you, however, som ething. Behind the brashness of little Haze, and the poise of big Haze, a trickle of shy life ran that tasted the sam e, that murmured the sam e. A great French doctor once told my Page 43

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

father that in near relatives the faintest gastric gurgle has the sam e "voice." So Charlotte sauntered in. She felt al was not wel between us. I had pretended to fal asleep the night before, and the night before that, as soon as we had gone to bed, and had risen at dawn. Tenderly, she inquired if she were not "interrupting."

"Not at the moment," I said, turning volum e C of the Girls' Encyclopedia around to exam ine a picture printed "bottom -edge" as printers say. Charlotte went up to a little table of imitation m ahogany with a drawer. She put her hand upon it. The little table was ugly, no doubt, but it had done nothing to her.

"I have always wanted to ask you," she said (businesslike, not coquettish), "why is this thing locked up? Do you want it in this room ? It's so abom inably uncouth."

"Leave it alone," I said. I was Cam ping in Scandinavia.

"Is there a key?"

"Hidden."

"Oh, Hum . . . "

"Locked up love letters."

She gave me one of those wounded-doe looks that irritated me so much, and then, not quite knowing if I was serious, or how to keep up the conversation, stood for several slow pages (Cam pus, Canada, Candid Cam era, Candy) peering at the window pane rather than through it, drumming upon it with sharp alm ond-and-rose fingernails. Presently (at Canoeing or Canvasback) she strol ed up to my chair and sank down, tweedily, weightily, on its arm, inundating me with the perfum e my first wife had used.

"W ould his lordship like to spend the fal here?" she asked, pointing with her little finger at an autum n view in a conservative Eastern State. "W hy?" (very distinctly and slowly). She shrugged. (Probably Harold used to take a vacation at that time. Open season. Conditional reflex on her part.)

"I think I know where that is," she said, stil pointing. "There is a hotel I rem em ber, Enchanted Hunters, quaint, isn't it? And the food is a dream . And nobody bothers anybody."

She rubbed her cheek against my tem ple. Valeria soon got over that.

"Is there anything special you would like for dinner, dear? John and Jean wil drop in later."

I answered with a grunt. She kissed me on my underlip, and, brightly saying she would bake a cake (a tradition subsisted from my lodging days that I adored her cakes), left me to my idleness.

Careful y putting down the open book where she had sat (it attem pted to send forth a rotation of waves, but an inserted pencil stopped the pages), I checked the hiding place of the key: rather self-consciously it lay under the old expensive safety razor I had used before she bought me a much better and cheaper one. W as it the perfect hiding placethere, under the razor, in the groove of its velvet-lined case? The case lay in a sm al trunk where I kept various business papers. Could I improve upon this? Rem arkable how difficult it is to conceal things-especial y when one's wife keeps m onkeying with the furniture.

I think it was exactly a week after our last swim that the noon mail brought a reply from the second M iss Phalen. The lady wrote she had just returned to St. Algebra from her sister's funeral. "Euphem ia had never been the sam e after breaking that hip." As to the matter of M rs. Humbert's daughter, she wished to report that it was too late to enrol her this year; but that she, the surviving Phalen, was practical y certain that if M r. and M rs. Humbert brought Dolores over in January, her adm ittance might be arranged. Next day, after lunch, I went to see "our" doctor, a friendly fel ow whose perfect bedside Page 44

m anner and com plete reliance on a few patented drugs adequately masked his ignorance of, and indifference to, medical science. The fact that Lo would have to com e back to Ram sdale was a treasure of anticipation. For this event I wanted to be ful y prepared. I had in fact begun my cam paign earlier, before Charlotte made that cruel decision of hers. I had to be sure when my lovely child arrived, that very night, and then night after night, until St. Algebra took her away from me, I would possess the m eans of putting two creatures to sleep so thoroughly that neither sound nor touch should rouse them . Throughout most of July I had been experimenting with various sleeping powders, trying them out on Charlotte, a great taker of pil s. The last dose I had given her (she thought it was a tablet of mild brom ides-to anoint her nerves) had knocked her out for four solid hours. I had put the radio at ful blast. I had blazed in her face an olisbos-like flashlight. I had pushed her, pinched her, prodded her-and nothing had disturbed the rhythm of her calm and powerful breathing. However, when I had done such a simple thing as kiss her, she had awakened at once, as fresh and strong as an octopus (I barely escaped). This would not do, I thought; had to get som ething stil safer. At first, Dr. Byron did not seem to believe me when I said his last prescription was no match for my insom nia. He suggested I try again, and for a moment diverted my attention by showing me photographs of his fam ily. He had a fascinating child of Dol y's age; but I saw through his tricks and insisted he prescribe the mightiest pil extant. He suggested I play golf, but final y agreed to give me som ething that, he said, "would real y work"; and going to a cabinet, he produced a vial of violet-blue capsules banded with dark purple at one end, which, he said, had just been placed on the market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm if properly adm inistered, but only for great sleepless artists who had to die for a few hours in order to live for centuries. I love to fool doctors, and though inwardly rejoicing, pocketed the pil s with a skeptical shrug. Incidental y, I had had to be careful with him. Once, in another connection, a stupid lapse on my part made me mention my last sanatorium , and I thought I saw the tips of his ears twitch. Being not at al keen for Charlotte or anybody else to know that period of my past, I had hastily explained that I had once done som e research am ong the insane for a novel. But no matter; the old rogue certainly had a sweet girleen.

I left in great spirits. Steering my wife's car with one finger, I contentedly rol ed hom eward. Ram sdale had, after al , lots of charm. The cicadas whirred; the avenue had been freshly watered. Sm oothly, almost silkily, I turned down into our steep little street. Everything was som ehow so right that day. So blue and green. I knew the sun shone because my ignition key was reflected in the windshield; and I knew it was exactly half past three because the nurse who cam e to m assage M iss Opposite every afternoon was tripping down the narrow sidewalk in her white stockings and shoes. As usual, Junk's hysterical setter attacked me as I rol ed downhil , and as usual, the local paper was lying on the porch where it had just been hurled by Kenny.

The day before I had ended the regime of aloofness I had im posed upon myself, and now uttered a cheerful hom ecom ing cal as I opened the door of the living room . W ith her ream -white nape and bronze bun to me, wearing the yel ow blouse and maroon slacks she had on when I first met her, Charlotte sat at the corner bureau writing a letter. M y hand stil on the doorknob, I repeated my hearty cry. Her writing hand stopped. She sat stil for a moment; then she slowly turned in her chair and rested her elbow on its curved back. Her face, disfigured by her em otion, was not a pretty sight as she stared at my legs and said:

"The Haze woman, the big bitch, the old cat, the obnoxious mamma, the-the old stupid Haze is no longer your dupe. She has-she has . . ."

M y fair accuser stopped, swal owing her venom and her tears. W hatever Humbert Humbert said-or attem pted to say-is inessential. She went on: Page 45

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"You're a m onster. You're a detestable, abom inable, criminal fraud. If you com e near-I'l scream out the window. Get back!" Again, whatever H.H. murmured may be om itted, I think.

"I am leaving tonight. This is al yours. Only you'l never, never see that miserable brat again. Get out of this room ."

Reader, I did. I went up to the ex-sem i-studio. Arms akim bo, I stood for a moment quite stil and self-com posed, surveying from the threshold the raped little table with its open drawer, a key hanging from the lock, four other household keys on the table top. I walked across the landing into the Humberts' bedroom , and calmly rem oved my diary from under her pil ow into my pocket. Then I started to walk downstairs, but stopped half-way: she was talking on the telephone which happened to be plugged just outside the door of the living room . I wanted to hear what she was saying: she canceled an order for som ething or other, and returned to the parlor. I rearranged my respiration and went through the hal way to the kitchen. There, I opened a bottle of Scotch. She could never resist Scotch. Then I walked into the dining room and from there, through the half-open door, contem plated Charlotte's broad back.

"You are ruining my life and yours," I said quietly. "Let us be civilized people. It is al your hal ucination. You are crazy, Charlotte. The notes you found were fragm ents of a novel. Your nam e and hers were put in by mere chance. Just because they cam e handy. Think it over. I shal bring you a drink."

She neither answered nor turned, but went on writing in a scorching scrawl whatever she was writing. A third letter, presum ably (two in stam ped envelopes were already laid out on the desk). I went back to the kitchen.

I set out two glasses (to St. Algebra? to Lo?) and opened the refrigerator. It roared at me viciously while I rem oved the ice from its heart. Rewrite. Let her read it again. She wil not recal details. Change, forge. W rite a fragm ent and show it to her or leave it lying around. W hy do faucets som etimes whine so horribly? A horrible situation, real y. The little pil ow-shaped blocks of ice-pil ows for polar teddy bear, Lo-em itted rasping, crackling, tortured sounds as the warm water loosened them in their cel s. I bum ped down the glasses side by side. I poured in the whiskey and a dram of soda. She had tabooed my pin. Bark and bang went the icebox. Carrying the glasses, I walked through the dining room and spoke through the parlor door which was a fraction ajar, not quite space enough for my elbow.

"I have made you a drink," I said.

She did not answer, the mad bitch, and I placed the glasses on the sideboard near the telephone, which had started to ring.

"Leslie speaking. Leslie Tom son," said Leslie Tom son who favored a dip at dawn. "M

rs. Humbert, sir, has been run over and you'd better com e quick." I answered, perhaps a bit testily, that my wife was safe and sound, and stil holding the receiver, I pushed open the door and said:

"There's this man saying you've been kil ed, Charlotte." But there was no Charlotte in the living room .

23

I rushed out. The far side of our steep little street presented a peculiar sight. A big black glossy Packard had climbed M iss Opposite's sloping lawn at an angle from the sidewalk (where a tartan laprobe had dropped in a heap), and stood there, shining in the sun, its doors open like wings, its front wheels deep in evergreen shrubbery. To the anatom ical right of this car, on the trim turn of the lawn-slope, an old gentlem an with a white mustache, wel -dressed-double-breasted gray suit, polka-dotted bow-tie-lay supine, his long legs together, like a death-size wax figure. I have to put the im pact of an instantaneous vision into a sequence of words; their physical accum ulation in the page Page 46

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

impairs the actual flash, the sharp unity of impression: Rug-heap, car, old man-dol , M iss O.'s nurse running with a rustle, a half-em pty tum bler in her hand, back to the screened porch-where the propped-up, imprisoned, decrepit lady herself may be imagined screeching, but not loud enough to drown the rhythm ical yaps of the Junk setter walking from group to group-from a bunch of neighbors already col ected on the sidewalk, near the bit of checked stuff, and back to the car which he had final y run to earth, and then to another group on the lawn, consisting of Leslie, two policem en and a sturdy man with tortoise shel glasses. At this point, I should explain that the prom pt appearance of the patrolmen, hardly more than a minute after the accident, was due to their having been ticketing the il egal y parked cars in a cross lane two blocks down the grade; that the fel ow with the glasses was Frederick Beale, Jr., driver of the Packard; that his 79yearold father, whom the nurse had just watered on the green bank where he lay-a banked banker so to speak-was not in a dead faint, but was com fortably and methodical y recovering from a mild heart attack or its possibility; and, final y, that the laprobe on the sidewalk (where she had so often pointed out to me with disapproval the crooked green cracks) concealed the mangled rem ains of Charlotte Humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the Beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the mailbox, at the corner of M iss Opposite's lawn. These were picked up and handed to me by a pretty child in a dirty pink frock, and I got rid of them by clawing them to fragm ents in my trouser pocket. Three doctors and the Farlows presently arrived on the scene and took over. The widower, a man of exceptional self-control, neither wept nor raved. He staggered a bit, that he did; but he opened his m outh only to impart such information or issue such directions as were strictly necessary in connection with the identification, exam ination and disposal of a dead woman, the top of her head a porridge of bone, brains, bronze hair and blood. The sun was stil a blinding red when he was put to bed in Dol y's room by his two friends, gentle John and dewy-eyed Jean; who, to be near, retired to the Humberts'

bedroom for the night; which, for al I know, they may not have spent as innocently as the solem nity of the occasion required.

I have no reason to dwel , in this very special memoir, on the pre-funeral formalities that had to be attended to, or on the funeral itself, which was as quiet as the marriage had been. But a few incidents pertaining to those four or five days after Charlotte's simple death, have to be noted.

M y first night of widowhood I was so drunk that I slept as soundly as the child who had slept in that bed. Next morning I hastened to inspect the fragm ents of letters in my pocket. They had got too thoroughly mixed up to be sorted into three com plete sets. I assum ed that ". . . and you had better find it because I cannot buy . . . " cam e from a letter to Lo; and other fragm ents seem ed to point to Charlotte's intention of fleeing with Lo to Parkington, or even back to Pisky, lest the vulture snatch her precious lam b. Other tatters and shreds (never had I thought I had such strong talons) obviously referred to an application not to St. A. but to another boarding school which was said to be so harsh and gray and gaunt in its methods (although supplying croquet under the elms) as to have earned the nicknam e of "Reformatory for Young Ladies." Final y, the third epistle was obviously addressed to me. I made out such item s as ". . . after a year of separation we may . . . " ". . . oh, my dearest, oh my . . . " ". . . worse than if it had been a woman you kept . . ." ". . . or, maybe, I shal die . . ." But on the whole my gleanings made little sense; the various fragm ents of those three hasty missives were as jum bled in the palms of my hands as their elem ents had been in poor Charlotte's head. That day John had to see a custom er, and Jean had to feed her dogs, and so I was to be deprived tem porarily of my friends' com pany. The dear people were afraid I might commit suicide if left alone, and since no other friends were available (M iss Opposite Page 47

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

was incom m unicado, the M cCoos were busy building a new house miles away, and the Chatfields had been recently cal ed to M aine by som e fam ily trouble of their own), Leslie and Louise were commissioned to keep me com pany under the pretense of helping me to sort out and pack a multitude of orphaned things. In a moment of superb inspiration I showed the kind and credulous Farlows (we were waiting for Leslie to com e for his paid tryst with Louise) a little photograph of Charlotte I had found am ong her affairs. From a boulder she sm iled through blown hair. It had been taken in April 1934, a memorable spring. W hile on a business visit to the States, I had had occasion to spend several m onths in Pisky. W e met-and had a mad love affair. I was married, alas, and she was engaged to Haze, but after I returned to Europe, we corresponded through a friend, now dead. Jean whispered she had heard som e rum ors and looked at the snapshot, and, stil looking, handed it to John, and John rem oved his pipe and looked at lovely and fast Charlotte Becker, and handed it back to me. Then they left for a few hours. Happy Louise was gurgling and scolding her swain in the basem ent.

hardly had the Farlows gone than a blue-chinned cleric cal ed-and I tried to make the interview as brief as was consistent with neither hurting his feelings nor arousing his doubts. Yes, I would devote al my life to the child's welfare. Here, incidental y, was a little cross that Charlotte Becker had given me when we were both young. I had a fem ale cousin, a respectable spinster in New York. There we would find a good private school for Dol y. Oh, what a crafty Humbert!

For the benefit of Leslie and Louise who might (and did) report it to John and Jean I made a trem endously loud and beautiful y enacted long-distance cal and simulated a conversation with Shirley Holmes. W hen John and Jean returned, I com pletely took them in by tel ing them , in a deliberately wild and confused mutter, that Lo had gone with the intermediate group on a five-day hike and could not be reached.

"Good Lord," said Jean, "what shal we do?" John said it was perfectly simple-he would get the Climax police to find the hikers-it would not take them an hour. In fact, he knew the country and-"Look," he continued, "why don' I drive there right now, and you may sleep with Jean"-(he did not real y add that but Jean supported his offer so passionately that it might be implied).

I broke down. I pleaded with John to let things rem ain the way they were. I said I could not bear to have the child al around me, sobbing, clinging to me, she was so high-strung, the experience might react on her future, psychiatrists have analyzed such cases. There was a sudden pause.

"W el , you are the doctor," said John a little bluntly. "But after al I was Charlotte's friend and adviser. One would like to know what you are going to do about the child anyway."

"John," cried Jean, "she is his child, not Harold Haze's. Don't you understand? Humbert is Dol y's real father."

"I see," said John. "I am sorry. Yes. I see. I did not realize that. It simplifies matters, of course. And whatever you feel is right."

The distraught father went on to say he would go and fetch his delicate daughter immediately after the funeral, and would do his best to give her a good time in total y different surroundings, perhaps a trip to New M exico or California-granted, of course, he lived.

So artistical y did I impersonate the calm of ultimate despair, the hush before som e crazy outburst, that the perfect Farlows rem oved me to their house. They had a good cel ar, as cel ars go in this country; and that was helpful, for I feared insom nia and a ghost. Now I must explain my reasons for keeping Dolores away. Natural y, at first, when Charlotte had just been eliminated and I re-entered the house a free father, and gulped down the two whiskey-and-sodas I had prepared, and topped them with a pint or two of Page 48

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

my "pin," and went to the bathroom to get away from neighbors and friends, there was but one thing in my mind and pulse-nam ely, the awareness that a few hours hence, warm, brown-haired, and mine, mine, mine, Lolita would be in my arms, shedding tears that I would kiss away faster than they could wel . But as I stood wide-eyed and flushed before the mirror, John Farlow tenderly tapped to inquire if I was okay-and I immediately realized it would be m adness on my part to have her in the house with al those busybodies mil ing around and schem ing to take her away from me. Indeed, unpredictable Lo herself might-who knows?-show som e foolish distrust of me, a sudden repugnance, vague fear and the like-and gone would be the magic prize at the very instant of trium ph.

Speaking of busybodies, I had another visitor-friend Beale, the fel ow who eliminated my wife. Stodgy and solem n, looking like a kind of assistant executioner, with his bul dog jowls, sm al black eyes, thickly rimmed glasses and conspicuous nostrils, he was ushered in by John who then left us, closing the door upon us, with the utmost tact. Suavely saying he had twins in my stepdaughter's class, my grotesque visitor unrol ed a large diagram he had made of the accident. It was, as my stepdaughter would have put it,

"a beaut," with al kinds of impressive arrows and dotted lines in varicolored inks. M rs. H.H.'s trajectory was il ustrated at several points by a series of those little outline figuresdol -like wee career girl or W AC-used in statistics as visual aids. Very clearly and conclusively, this route cam e into contact with a boldly traced sinuous line representing two consecutive swerves-one which the Beale car made to avoid the Junk dog (dog not shown), and the second, a kind of exaggerated continuation of the first, m eant to avert the tragedy. A very black cross indicated the spot where the trim little outline figure had at last com e to rest on the sidewalk. I looked for som e similar mark to denote the place on the em bankm ent where my visitor's huge wax father had reclined, but there was none. That gentlem an, however, had signed the docum ent as a witness underneath the nam e of Leslie Tom son, M iss Opposite and a few other people. W ith his hummingbird pencil deftly and delicately flying from one point to another, Frederick dem onstrated his absolute innocence and the recklessness of my wife: while he was in the act of avoiding the dog, she slipped on the freshly watered asphalt and plunged forward whereas she should have flung herself not forward but backward (Fred showed how by a jerk of his padded shoulder). I said it was certainly not his fault, and the inquest upheld my view. Breathing violently though jet-black tense nostrils, he shook his head and my hand; then, with an air of perfect savoir vivre and gentlem anly generosity, he offered to pay the funeral-hom e expenses. He expected me to refuse his offer. W ith a drunken sob of gratitude I accepted it. This took him aback. Slowly, incredulously, he repeated what he had said. I thanked him again, even more profusely than before. In result of that weird interview, the num bness of my soul was for a moment resolved. And no wonder! I had actual y seen the agent of fate. I had palpated the very flesh of fate-and its padded shoulder. A bril iant and m onstrous mutation had suddenly taken place, and here was the instrum ent. W ithin the intricacies of the pattern (hurrying housewife, slippery pavem ent, a pest of a dog, steep grade, big car, baboon at its wheel), I could dimly distinguish my own vile contribution. Had I not been such a fool-or such an intuitive genius-to preserve that journal, fluids produced by vindictive anger and hot sham e would not have blinded Charlotte in her dash to the mailbox. But even had they blinded her, stil nothing might have happened, had not precise fate, that synchronizing phantom , mixed within its alem bic the car and the dog and the sun and the shade and the wet and the weak and the strong and the stone. Adieu, M arlene! Fat fate's formal handshake (as reproduced by Beale before leaving the room ) brought me out of my torpor; and I wept. Ladies and gentlem en of the jury-I wept. Page 49

The elms and the poplars were turning their ruffled backs to a sudden onslaught of wind, and a black thunderhead loom ed above Ram sdale's white church tower when I looked around me for the last time. For unknown adventures I was leaving the livid house where I had rented a room only ten weeks before. The shades-thrifty, practical bam boo shadeswere already down. On porches or in the house their rich textures lend m odern dram a. The house of heaven must seem pretty bare after that. A raindrop fel on my knuckles. I went back into the house for som ething or other while John was putting my bags into the car, and then a funny thing happened. I do not know if in these tragic notes I have sufficiently stressed the peculiar "sending" effect that the writer's good looks-pseudoCeltic, attractively simian, boyishly manly-had on women of every age and environm ent. Of course, such announcem ents made in the first person may sound ridiculous. But every once in a while I have to rem ind the reader of my appearance much as a professional novelist, who has given a character of his som e m annerism or a dog, has to go on producing that dog or that m annerism every time the character crops up in the course of the book. There may be more to it in the present case. M y gloom y good looks should be kept in the mind's eye if my story is to be properly understood. Pubescent Lo swooned to Humbert's charm as she did to hiccuppy music; adult Lotte loved me with a mature, possessive passion that I now deplore and respect more than I care to say. Jean Farlow, who was thirty-one and absolutely neurotic, had also apparently developed a strong liking for me. She was handsom e in a carved-Indian sort of way, with a burnt sienna com plexion. Her lips were like large crim son polyps, and when she em itted her special barking laugh, she showed large dul teeth and pale gum s. She was very tal , wore either slacks with sandals or bil owing skirts with bal et slippers, drank any strong liquor in any am ount, had had two miscarriages, wrote stories about animals, painted, as the reader knows, lakescapes, was already nursing the cancer that was to kil her at thirty-three, and was hopelessly unattractive to me. Judge then of my alarm when a few seconds before I left (she and I stood in the hal way) Jean, with her always trem bling fingers, took me by the tem ples, and, tears in her bright blue eyes, attem pted, unsuccessful y, to glue herself to my lips.

"Take care of yourself," she said, "kiss your daughter for me." A clap of thunder reverberated throughout the house, and she added:

"Perhaps, som ewhere, som e day, at a less miserable time, we may see each other again" (Jean, whatever, wherever you are, in minus time-space or plus soul-time, forgive me al this, parenthesis included).

And presently I was shaking hands with both of them in the street, the sloping street, and everything was whirling and flying before the approaching white deluge, and a truck with a mattress from Philadelphia was confidently rol ing down to an em pty house, and dust was running and writhing over the exact slab of stone where Charlotte, when they lifted the laprobe for me, had been revealed, curled up, her eyes intact, their black lashes stil wet, matted, like yours, Lolita.

One might suppose that with al blocks rem oved and a prospect of delirious and unlimited delights before me, I would have mental y sunk back, heaving a sigh of delicious relief. Eh bine, pas du tout! Instead of basking in the beam s of sm iling Chance, I was obsessed by al sorts of purely ethical doubts and fears. For instance: might it not surprise people that Lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral functions in her immediate fam ily? You rem em ber-we had not had her at our wedding. Or another thing: granted it was the long hairy arm of Coincidence that had reached out to rem ove an innocent woman, might Coincidence not ignore in a heathen moment what its twin lam b had done and hand Lo a prem ature note of commiseration?

True, the accident had been Page 50

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

reported only by the Ram sdale Journal-not by the Parkington Recorder or the Climax Herald, Cam p Q being in another state, and local deaths having no federal news interest; but I could not help fancying that som ehow Dol y Haze had been informed already, and that at the very time I was on my way to fetch her, she was being driven to Ram sdale by friends unknown to me. Stil more disquieting than al these conjectures and worries, was the fact that Humbert Humbert, a brand-new American citizen of obscure European origin, had taken no steps toward becom ing the legal guardian of his dead wife's daughter (twelve years and seven m onths old). W ould I ever dare take those steps? I could not repress a shiver whenever I imagined my nudity hem m ed in by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the Com m on Law.

M y schem e was a marvel of primitive art: I would whizz over to Cam p Q, tel Lolita her mother was about to undergo a major operation at an invented hospital, and then keep m oving with my sleepy nym phet from inn to inn while her mother got better and better and final y died. But as I traveled cam pward my anxiety grew. I could not bear to think I might not find Lolita there-or find, instead, another, scared, Lolita clam oring for som e fam ily friend: not the Farlows, thank God-she hardly knew them - but might there not be other people I had not reckoned with? Final y, I decided to make the long-distance cal I had simulated so wel a few days before. It was raining hard when I pul ed up in a m uddy suburb of Parkington, just before the Fork, one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which crossed the hil s to Lake Climax and Cam p Q. I flipped off the ignition and for quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone cal , and staring at the rain, at the inundated sidewalk, at a hydrant: a hideous thing, real y, painted a thick silver and red, extending the red stum ps of its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon its argent chains. No wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripples is taboo. I drove up to a gasoline station. A surprise awaited me when at last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was al owed to answer mine.

Holmes, the cam p mistress, informed me that Dol y had gone M onday (this was W

ednesday) on a hike in the hil s with her group and was expected to return rather late today. W ould I care to com e tom orrow, and what was exactly-W ithout going into details, I said that her mother was hospitalized, that the situation was grave, that the child should not be told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tom orrow afternoon. The two voices parted in an explosion of warmth and good wil , and through som e freak m echanical flaw al my coins cam e tum bling back to me with a hittingthejackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the disappointment at having to postpone bliss. One wonders if this sudden discharge, this spasm odic refund, was not correlated som ehow, in the mind of M cFate, with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning of it as I did now.

W hat next? I proceeded to the business center of Parkington and devoted the whole afternoon (the weather had cleared, the wet town was like silver-and-glass) to buying beautiful things for Lo. Goodness, what crazy purchases were prom pted by the poignant predilection Humbert had in those days for check weaves, bright cottons, fril s, puffedout short sleeves, soft pleats, snug-fitting bodices and generously ful skirts! Oh Lolita, you are my girl, as Vee was Poe's and Bea Dante's, and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties? Did I have som ething special in mind? coaxing voices asked me. Swimming suits? W e have them in al shades. Dream pink, frosted aqua, glans m auve, tulip red, oolala black. W hat about paysuits? Slips? No slips. Lo and I loathed slips.

One of my guides in these matters was an anthropom etric entry made by her mother on Lo's twelfth birthday (the reader rem em bers that Know-Your-Child book). I had the Page 51

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

feeling that Charlotte, m oved by obscure motives of envy and dislike, had added an inch here, a pound there; but since the nym phet had no doubt grown som ewhat in the last seven m onths, I thought I could safely accept most of those January m easurem ents: hip girth, twenty-nine inches; thigh girth (just below the gluteal sulcus), seventeen; calf girth and neck circum ference, eleven; chest circum ference, twenty-seven; upper arm girth, eight; waist, twenty-three; stature, fifty-seven inches; weight, seventy-eight pounds; figure, linear; intel igence quotient, 121; vermiform appendix present, thank God. Apart from m easurem ents, I could of course visualize Lolita with hal ucinational lucidity; and nursing as I did a tingle on my breastbone at the exact spot her silky top had com e level once or twice with my heart; and feeling as I did her warm weight in my lap (so that, in a sense, I was always "with Lolita" as a woman is "with child"), I was not surprised to discover later that my com putation had been more or less correct. Having moreover studied a midsum m er sale book, it was with a very knowing air that I exam ined various pretty articles, sport shoes, sneakers, pum ps of crushed kid for crushed kids. The painted girl in black who attended to al these poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description into commercial euphem ism s, such as "petite." Another, much older woman, in a white dress, with a pancake make-up, seem ed to be oddly impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions; perhaps I had a midget for mistress; so, when shown a skirt with "cute" pockets in front, I intentional y put a naive male question and was rewarded by a sm iling dem onstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt. I had next great fun with al kinds of shorts and briefs-phantom little Lolitas dancing, fal ing, daisying al over the counter. W e rounded up the deal with som e prim cotton pajam as in popular butcher-boy style. Humbert, the popular butcher. There is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large stores where according to ads a career girl can get a com plete desk-to-date wardrobe, and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey wil make the boys in the back row of the classroom drool. Life-size plastic figures of snubbed-nosed children with duncolored, greenish, brown-dotted, faunish faces floated around me. I realized I was the only shopper in that rather eerie place where I m oved about fishlike, in a glaucous aquarium . I sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that escorted me from counter to counter, from rock ledge to seaweed, and the belts and the bracelets I chose seem ed to fal from siren hands into transparent water. I bought an elegant valise, had my purchases put into it, and repaired to the nearest hotel, wel pleased with my day. Som ehow, in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious shopping, I recal ed the hotel or inn with the seductive nam e of The Enchanted Hunters with Charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my liberation. W ith the help of a guidebook I located it in the secluded town of Briceland, a four-hour drive from Lo's cam p. I could have telephoned but fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coy croaks of broken English, I decided to send a wire ordering a room with twin beds for the next night. W hat a com ic, clum sy, wavering Prince Charming I was!

How som e of my readers wil laugh at me when I tel them the trouble I had with the wording of my telegram ! W hat should I put: Humbert and daughter? Humberg and sm al daughter? Homberg and immature girl? Hom burg and child? The drol mistake-the "g" at the end-which eventual y cam e through may have been a telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine.

And then, in the velvet of a summer night, my broodings over the philer I had with me!

Oh miserly Ham burg! W as he not a very Enchanted Hunter as he deliberated with himself over his boxful of magic am m unition? To rout the m onster of insom nia should he try himself one of those am ethyst capsules? There were forty of them , al told-forty nights with a frail little sleeper at my throbbing side; could I rob myself of one such night Page 52

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

in order to sleep? Certainly not: much too precious was each tiny plum , each microscopic planetarium with its live startdust. Oh, let me be mawkish for the nonce! I am so tired of being cynical.

This daily headache in the opaque air of this tom bal jail is disturbing, but I must persevere. Have written more than a hundred pages and not got anywhere yet. M y calendar is getting confused. That must have been around August 15, 1947. Don't think I can go on. Heart, head-everything. Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita. Repeat til the page is ful , printer. 27

Stil in Parkington. Final y, I did achieve an hour's slum ber-from which I was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a sm al hairy herm aphrodite, a total stranger. By then it was six in the morning, and it suddenly occurred to me it might be a good thing to arrive at the cam p earlier than I had said. From Parkington I had stil a hundred miles to go, and there would be more than that to the Hazy Hil s and Briceland. If I had said I would com e for Dol y in the afternoon, it was only because my fancy insisted on merciful night fal ing as soon as possible upon my impatience. But now I foresaw al kinds of misunderstandings and was al a-jitter lest delay might give her the opportunity of som e idle telephone cal to Ram sdale. However, when at 9.30 a.m. I attem pted to start, I was confronted by a dead battery, and noon was nigh when at last I left Parkington.

I reached my destination around half past two; parked my car in a pine grove where a green-shirted, redheaded impish lad stood throwing horseshoes in sul en solitude; was laconical y directed by him to an office in a stucco cottage; in a dying state, had to endure for several minutes the inquisitive commiseration of the cam p mistress, a sluttish worn out fem ale with rusty hair. Dol y she said was al packed and ready to go. She knew her mother was sick but not critical y. W ould M r. Haze, I m ean, M r. Humbert, care to m eet the cam p counselors? Or look at the cabins where the girls live? Each dedicated to a Disney creature? Or visit the Lodge? Or should Charlie be sent over to fetch her? The girls were just finishing fixing the Dining Room for a dance. (And perhaps afterwards she would say to som ebody or other: "The poor guy looked like his own ghost.") Let me retain for a moment that scene in al its trivial and fateful detail: hag Holmes writing out a receipt, scratching her head, pul ing a drawer out of her desk, pouring change into my impatient palm, then neatly spreading a banknote over it with a bright ". .

. and five!"; photographs of girl-children; som e gaudy moth or butterfly, stil alive, safely pinned to the wal ("nature study"); the fram ed diplom a of the cam p's dietitian; my trem bling hands; a card produced by efficient Holmes with a report of Dol y Haze's behavior for July ("fair to good; keen on swimming and boating"); a sound of trees and birds, and my pounding heart . . . I was standing with my back to the open door, and then I felt the blood rush to my head as I heart her respiration and voice behind me. She arrived dragging and bum ping her heavy suitcase. "Hi!" she said, and stood stil , looking at me with sly, glad eyes, her soft lips parted in a slightly foolish but wonderful y endearing sm ile.

She was thinner and tal er, and for a second it seem ed to me her face was less pretty than the mental imprint I had cherished for more than a m onth: her cheeks looked hol owed and too much lentigo cam ouflaged her rosy rustic features; and that first impression (a very narrow hum an interval between two tiger heartbeats) carried the clear implication that al widower Humbert had to do, wanted to do, or would do, was to give this wanlooking though sun-colored little orphan au yeux battus (and even those plum baceous um brae under her eyes bore freckles) a sound education, a healthy and happy girlhood, a clean hom e, nice girl-friends of her age am ong whom (if the fates deigned to repay me) I Page 53

might find, perhaps, a pretty little M agdlein for Herr Doktor Humbert alone. But "in a wink," as the Germans say, the angelic line of conduct was erased, and I overtook my prey (time m oves ahead of our fancies!), and she was my Lolita again-in fact, more of my Lolita than ever. I let my hand rest on her warm auburn head and took up her bag. She was al rose and honey, dressed in her brightest gingham , with a pattern of little red apples, and her arms and legs were of a deep golden brown, with scratches like tiny dotted lines of coagulated rubies, and the ribbed cuffs of her white socks were turned down at the rem em bered level, and because of her childish gait, or because I had memorized her as always wearing heel ess shoes, her saddle oxfords looked som ehow too large and too high-heeled for her. Good-bye, Cam p Q, merry Cam p Q. Good-bye, plain unwholesom e food, good-bye Charlie boy. In the hot car she settled down beside me, slapped a prom pt fly on her lovely knee; then, her m outh working violently on a piece of chewing gum , she rapidly cranked down the window on her side and settled back again. W e sped through the striped and speckled forest.

"How's M other?" she asked dutiful y.

I said the doctors did not quite know yet what the trouble was. Anyway, som ething abdom inal. Abom inable? No, abdom inal. W e would have to hang around for a while. The hospital was in the country, near the gay town of Lepingvil e, where a great poet had resided in the early nineteenth century and where we would take in al the shows. She thought it a peachy idea and wondered if we could make Lepingvil e before nine p.m.

"W e should be at Briceland by dinner time," I said, "and tom orrow we'l visit Lepingvil e. How was the hike? Did you have a marvelous time at the cam p?"

"Uh-huh."

"Sorry to leave?"

"Un-un."

"Talk, Lo-don't grunt. Tel me som ething."

"W hat thing, Dad?" (she let the word expand with ironic deliberation).

"Any old thing."

"Okay, if I cal you that?" (eyes slit at the road).

"Quite."

"It's a sketch, you know. W hen did you fal for my mummy?"

"Som e day, Lo, you wil understand many em otions and situations, such as for exam ple the harm ony, the beauty of spiritual relationship."

"Bah!" said the cynical nym phet.

Shal ow lul in the dialogue, fil ed with som e landscape.

"Look, Lo, at al those cows on that hil side."

"I think I'l vom it if I look at a cow again."

"You know, I missed you terribly, Lo."

"I did not. Fact I've been revoltingly unfaithful to you, but it does not matter one bit, because you've stopped caring for me, anyway. You drive much faster than my mummy, mister."

I slowed down from a blind seventy to a purblind fifty.

"W hy do you think I have ceased caring for you, Lo?"

"W el , you haven't kissed me yet, have you?"

Inly dying, inly moaning, I glimpsed a reasonably wide shoulder of road ahead, and bum ped and wobbled into the weeds. Remember she is only a child, rem em ber she is onlyHardly had the car com e to a standstil than Lolita positively flowed into my arms. Not daring, not daring let myself go-not even daring let myself realize that this (sweet wetness and trem bling fire) was the beginning of the ineffable life which, ably assisted by fate, I had final y wil ed into being-not daring real y kiss her, I touched her hot, opening Page 54

lips with the utmost piety, tiny sips, nothing salacious; but she, with an impatient wriggle, pressed her m outh to mine so hard that I felt her big front teeth and shared in the peppermint taste of her saliva. I knew, of course, it was but an innocent gam e on her part, a bit of backfisch foolery in imitation of som e simulacrum of fake rom ance, and since (as the psychotherapist, as wel as the rapist, wil tel you) the limits and rules of such girlish gam es are fluid, or at least too childishly subtle for the senior partner to grasp-I was dreadful y afraid I might go too far and cause her to start back in revulsion and terror. And, as above al I was agonizingly anxious to sm uggle her into the hermetic seclusion of The Enchanged Hunters, and we had stil eighty miles to go, blessed intuition broke our em brace-a split second before a highway patrol car drew up alongside. Florid and beetle-browed, its driver stared at me:

"Happen to see a blue sedan, sam e make as yours, pass you before the junction?"

"W hy, no."

"W e didn't," said Lo, eagerly leaning across me, her innocent hand on my legs, "but are you sure it was blue, because-"

The cop (what shadow of us was he after?) gave the little col een his best sm ile and went into a U-turn.

W e drove on.

"The fruithead!" rem arked Lo. "He should have nabbed you."

"W hy me for heaven's sake?"

"W el , the speed in this bum state is fifty, and-No, don't slow down, you, dul bulb. He's gone now."

"W e have stil quite a stretch," I said, "and I want to get there before dark. So be a good girl."

"Bad, bad girl," said Lo com fortably. "Juvenile delickwent, but frank and fetching. That light was red. I've never seen such driving."

W e rol ed silently through a silent townlet.

"Say, wouldn't M other be absolutely mad if she found out we were lovers?"

"Good Lord, Lo, let us not talk that way."

"But we are lovers, aren't we?"

"Not that I know of. I think we are going to have som e more rain. Don't you want to tel me of those little pranks of yours in cam p?"

"You talk like a book, Dad."

"W hat have you been up to? I insist you tel me."

"Are you easily shocked?"

"No. Go on."

"Let us turn into a secluded lane and I'l tel you."

"Lo, I must seriously ask you not to play the fool. W el ?"

"W el -I joined in al the activities that were offered."

"Ensuite?"

"Ansooit, I was taught to live happily and richly with others and to develop a wholesom e personality. Be a cake, in fact."

"Yes. I saw som ething of the sort in the booklet."

"W e loved the sings around the fire in the big stone fireplace or under the darned stars, where every girl merged her own spirit of happiness with the voice of the group."

"Your memory is excel ent, Lo, but I must trouble you to leave out the swear words. Anything else?"

"The Girl Scout's motto," said Lo rhapsodical y, "is also mine. I fil my life with worthwhile deeds such as-wel , never mind what. M y duty is-to be useful. I am a friend to male animals. I obey orders. I am cheerful. That was another police car. I am thrifty and I am absolutely filthy in thought, word and deed." Page 55

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"Now I do hope that's al , you witty child."

"Yep. That's al . No-wait a sec. W e baked in a reflector oven. Isn't that terrific?"

"W el , that's better."

"W e washed zil ions of dishes. 'Zil ions' you know is schoolmarm's slang for manymanymany-many. Oh yes, last but not least, as M other says-Now let me see-what was it? I know we made shadowgraphs. Gee, what fun."

"C'est bien tout?"

"C'est. Except for one little thing, som ething I simply can't tel you without blushing al over."

"W il you tel it me later?"

"If we sit in the dark and you let me whisper, I wil . Do you sleep in your old room or in a heap with M other?"

"Old room . Your mother may have to undergo a very serious operation, Lo."

"Stop at that candy bar, wil you," said Lo.

Sitting on a high stool, a band of sunlight crossing her bare brown forearm, Lolita was served an elaborate ice-cream concoction topped with synthetic syrup. It was erected and brought her by a pimply brute of a boy in a greasy bow-tie who eyed my fragile child in her thin cotton frock with carnal deliberation. M y impatience to reach Briceland and The Enchanted Hunters was becom ing more than I could endure. Fortunately she dispatched the stuff with her usual alacrity.

"How much cash do you have?" I asked.

"Not a cent," she said sadly, lifting her eyebrows, showing me the em pty inside of her m oney purse.

"This is a matter that wil be m ended in due time," I rejoined archly. "Are you com ing?"

"Say, I wonder if they have a washroom ."

"you are not going there," I said Firmly. "It is sure to be a vile place. Do com e on." She was on the whole an obedient little girl and I kissed her in the neck when we got back into the car.

"Don't do that," she said looking at me with unfeigned surprise. "Don't drool on me. You dirty man."

She rubbed the spot against her raised shoulder.

"Sorry," I murmured. "I'm rather fond of you, that's al ." W e drove under a gloom y sky, up a winding road, then down again.

"W el , I'm also sort of fond of you," said Lolita in a delayed soft voice, with a sort of sigh, and sort of settled closer to me.

(Oh, my Lolita, we shal never get there!)

Dusk was beginning to saturate pretty little Briceland, its phony colonial architecture, curiosity sops and im ported shade trees, when we drove through the weakly lighted streets in search of the Enchanted Hunters. The air, despite a steady drizzle beading it, was warm and green, and a queue of people, mainly children and old men, had already formed before the box office of a m ovie house, dripping with jewel-fires.

"Oh, I want to see that picture. Let's go right after dinner. Oh, let's!"

"W e might," chanted Humbert-knowing perfectly wel , the sly tum escent devil, that by nine, when his show began, she would be dead in his arms.

"Easy!" cried Lo, lurching forward, as an accursed truck in front of us, its backside carbuncles pulsating, stopped at a crossing.

If we did not get to the hotel soon, immediately, miraculously, in the very next block, I felt I would lose al control over the Haze jalopy with its ineffectual wipers and whimsical brakes; but the passers-by I applied to for directions were either strangers them selves or asked with a frown "Enchanted what?" as if I were a madman; or else they went into such com plicated explanations, with geom etrical gestures, geographical Page 56

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

generalities and strictly local clues (. . . then bear south after you hit the court-house. . .) that I could not help losing my way in the maze of their wel -m eaning gibberish. Lo, whose lovely prism atic entrails had already digested the sweetm eat, was looking forward to a big m eal and had begun to fidget. As to me, although I had long becom e used to a kind of secondary fate (M cFate's inept secretary, so to speak) pettily interfering with the boss's generous magnificent plan-to grind and grope through the avenues of Briceland was perhaps the most exasperating ordeal I had yet faced. In later m onths I could laugh at my inexperience when recal ing the obstinate boyish way in which I had concentrated upon that particular inn with its fancy nam e; for al along our route countless motor courts proclaimed their vacancy in neon lights, ready to accom m odate salesm en, escaped convicts, im potents, fam ily groups, as wel as the most corrupt and vigorous couples. Ah, gentle drivers gliding through summer's black nights, what frolics, what twists of lust, you might see from your im peccable highways if Kumfy Kabins were suddenly drained of their pigm ents and becam e as transparent as boxes of glass!

The miracle I hankered for did happen after al . A man and a girl, more or less conjoined in a dark car under dripping trees, told us we were in the heart of The Park, but had only to turn left at the next traffic light and there we would be. W e did not see any next traffic light-in fact, The Park was as black as the sins it concealed-but soon after fal ing under the sm ooth spel of a nicely graded curve, the travelers becam e aware of a diam ond glow through the mist, then a gleam of lakewater appeared-and there it was, marvelously and inexorably, under spectral trees, at the top of a graveled drive-the pale palace of The Enchanted Hunters.

A row of parked cars, like pigs at a trough, seem ed at first sight to forbid access; but then, by magic, a formidable convertible, resplendent, rubious in the lighted rain, cam e into motion-was energetical y backed out by a broad-shouldered driver-and we grateful y slipped into the gap it had left. I immediately regretted my haste for I noticed that my predecessor had now taken advantage of a garage-like shelter nearby where there was am ple space for another car; but I was too impatient to fol ow his exam ple.

"W ow! Looks swank," rem arked my vulgar darling squinting at the stucco as she crept out into the audible drizzle and with a childish hand tweaked loose the frock-fold that had struck in the peach-cleft-to quote Robert Browning. Under the arclights enlarged replicas of chestnut leaves plunged and played on white pil ars. I unlocked the trunk com partment. A hunchbacked and hoary Negro in a uniform of sorts took our bags and wheeled them slowly into the lobby. It was ful of old ladies and clergy men. Lolita sank down on her haunches to caress a pale-faced, blue-freckled, black-eared cocker spaniel swooning on the floral carpet under her hand-as who would not, my heart-while I cleared my throat through the throng to the desk. There a bald porcine old man-everybody was old in that old hotel-examined my features with a polite sm ile, then leisurely produced my (garbled) telegram , wrestled with som e dark doubts, turned his head to look at the clock, and final y said he was very sorry, he had held the room with the twin beds til half past six, and now it was gone. A religious convention, he said, had clashed with a flower show in Briceland, and-"The nam e," I said coldly, "is not Humberg and not Hum bug, but Herbert, I m ean Humbert, and any room wil do, just put in a cot for my little daughter. She is ten and very tired." The pink old fel ow peered good-naturedly at Lo-stil squatting, listening in profile, lips parted, to what the dog's mistress, an ancient lady swathed in violet veils, was tel ing her from the depths of a cretonne easy chair. W hatever doubts the obscene fel ow had, they were dispel ed by that blossom -like vision. He said, he might stil have a room , had one, in fact-with a double bed. As to the cot-"M r. Potts, do we have any cots left?" Potts, also pink and bald, with white hairs growing out of his ears and other holes, would see what could be done. He cam e and spoke while I Page 57

unscrewed my fountain pen. Impatient Humbert!

"Our double beds are real y triple," Potts cozily said tucking me and my kid in. "One crowded night we had three ladies and a child like yours sleep together. I believe one of the ladies was a disguised man [my static]. However-would there be a spare cot in 49, M

r. Swine?

"I think it went to the Swoons," said Swine, the initial old clown.

"W e'l manage som ehow," I said. "M y wife may join us later-but even then, I suppose, we'l manage."

The two pink pigs were now am ong my best friends. In the slow clear hand of crime I wrote: Dr. Edgar H. Humbert and daughter, 342 Lawn Street, Ram sdale. A key (342!) was half-shown to me (magician showing object he is about to palm)-and handed over to Uncle tom . Lo, leaving the dog as she would leave me som e day, rose from her haunches; a raindrop fel on Charlotte's grave; a handsom e young Negress slipped open the elevator door, and the doom ed child went in fol owed by her throat-clearing father and crayfish Tom with the bags.

Parody of a hotel corridor. Parody of silence and death.

"Say, it's our house num ber," said cheerful Lo.

There was a double bed, a mirror, a double bed in the mirror, a closet door with mirror, a bathroom door ditto, a blue-dark window, a reflected bed there, the sam e in the closet mirror, two chairs, a glass-topped table, two bedtables, a double bed: a big panel bed, to be exact, with a Tuscan rose chenil e spread, and two fril ed, pink-shaded nightlam ps, left and right.

I was tem pted to place a five-dol ar bil in that sepia palm, but thought the largesse might be misconstrued, so I placed a quarter. Added another. He withdrew. Click. Enfin seuls.

"Are we going to sleep in one room ?" said Lo, her features working in that dynam ic way they did-not cross or disgusted (though plain on the brink of it) but just dynam ic-when she wanted to load a question with violent significance.

"I've asked them to put in a cot. W hich I'l use if you like."

"You are crazy," said Lo.

"W hy, my darling?"

"Because, my dahrling, when dahrling M other finds out she'l divorce you and strangle me."

Just dynam ic. Not real y taking the matter too seriously.

"Now look here," I said, sitting down, while she stood, a few feet away from me, and stared at herself contentedly, not unpleasantly surprised at her own appearance, fil ing with her own rosy sunshine the surprised and pleased closet-door mirror.

"Look here, Lo. Let's settle this once for al . For al practical purposes I am your father. I have a feeling of great tenderness for you. In your mother's absence I am responsible for your welfare. W e are not rich, and while we travel, we shal be obliged-we shal be thrown a good deal together. Two people sharing one room , inevitably enter into a kindhow shal I say-a kind-"

"The word is incest," said Lo-and walked into the closet, walked out again with a young golden giggle, opened the adjoining door, and after careful y peering inside with her strange sm oky eyes lest she make another mistake, retired to the bathroom . I opened the window, tore off my sweat-drenched shirt, changed, checked the pil vial in my coat pocket, unlocked the-She drifted out. I tried to em brace her: casual y, a bit of control ed tenderness before dinner.

She said: "Look, let's cut out the kissing gam e and get som ething to eat." It was then that I sprang my surprise.

Oh, what a dream y pet! She walked up to the open suitcase as if stalking it from afar, at a Page 58

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

kind of slow-motion walk, peering at that distant treasure box on the luggage support. (W

as there som ething wrong, I wondered, with those great gray eyes of hers, or were we both plunged in the sam e enchanted mist?) She stepped up to it, lifting her rather highheeled feet rather high, and bending her beautiful boy-knees while she walked through dilating space with the lentor of one walking under water or in a flight dream . Then she raised by the armlets a copper-colored, charming and quite expensive vest, very slowly stretching it between her silent hands as if she were a bem used bird-hunter holding his breath over the incredible bird he spreads out by the tips of its flam ing wings. Then (while I stood waiting for her) she pul ed out the slow snake of a bril iant belt and tried it on.

Then she crept into my waiting arms, radiant, relaxed, caressing me with her tender, mysterious, im pure, indifferent, twilight eyes-for al the world, like the cheapest of cheap cuties. For that is what nym phets imitate-while we moan and die.

"W hat's the katter with misses?" I muttered (word-control gone) into her hair.

"If you must know," she said, "you do it the wrong way."

"Show, wight ray."

"Al in good time," responded the spoonerette.

Seva ascendes, pulsata, brulans, kizelans, dem entissima. Elevator clatterans, pausa, clatterans, populus in corridoro. Hanc nisi mors mihi adimet nem o! Juncea puel ula, jo pensavo fondissime, nobserva nihil quidquam ; but, of course, in another moment I might have committed som e dreadful blunder; fortunately, she returned to the treasure box. From the bathroom , where it took me quite a time to shift back into normal gear for a hum drum purpose, I heard, standing, drumming, retaining my breath, my Lolita's "oo's" and "gee's" of girlish delight.

She had used the soap only because it was sam ple soap.

"W el , com e on, my dear, if you are as hungry as I am ." And so to the elevator, daughter swinging her old white purse, father walking in front (nota bene: never behind, she is not a lady). As we stood (now side by side) waiting to be taken down, she threw back her head, yawned without restraint and shook her curls.

"W hen did they make you get up at that cam p?"

"Half-past-" she stifled another yawn-"six"-yawn in ful with a shiver of al her fram e. "Halfpast," she repeated, her throat fil ing up again. The dining room met us with a sm el of fried fat and a faded sm ile. It was a spacious and pretentious place with m audlin murals depicting enchanted hunters in various postures and states of enchantment am id a medley of pal id animals, dryads and trees. A few scattered old ladies, two clergym en, and a man in a sports coat were finishing their m eals in silence. The dining room closed at nine, and the green-clad, poker-faced serving girls were, happily, in a desperate hurry to get rid of us.

"Does not he look exactly, but exactly, like Quilty?" said Lo in a soft voice, her sharp brown elbow not pointing, but visibly burning to point, at the lone diner in the loud checks, in the far corner of the room .

"Like our fat Ram sdale dentist?"

Lo arrested the m outhful of water she had just taken, and put down her dancing glass.

"Course not," she said with a splutter of mirth. "I m eant the writer fel ow in the Drom es ad."

Oh, Fam e! Oh, Fem ina!

W hen the dessert was plunked down-a huge wedge of cherry pie for the young lady and vanil a ice cream her protector, most of which she expeditiously added to her pie-I produced a sm al vial containing Papa's Purple Pil s. As I look back at those seasick murals, at that strange and m onstrous moment, I can only explain my behavior then by the m echanism of that dream vacuum wherein revolves a deranged mind; but at the time, Page 59

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

it al seem ed quite simple and inevitable to me. I glanced around, satisfied myself that the last diner had left, rem oved the stopped, and with the utmost deliberation tipped the philter into my palm. I had careful y rehearsed before a mirror the gesture of clapping my em pty hand to my open m outh and swal owing a (fictitious) pil . As I expected, she pounced upon the vial with its plum p, beautiful y colored capsules loaded with Beauty's Sleep.

"Blue!" she exclaimed. "Violet blue. W hat are they made of?"

"Summer skies," I said, "and plum s and figs, and the grapeblood of em perors."

"No, seriously-please."

"Oh, just purpil s. Vitam in X. M akes one strong as an ox or an ax. W ant to try one?" Lolita stretched out her hand, nodding vigorously.

I had hoped the drug would work fast. It certainly did. She had had a long long day, she had gone rowing in the morning with Barbara whose sister was W aterfront Director, as the adorable accessible nym phet now started to tel me in between suppressed palatehum ping yawns, growing in volum e-oh, how fast the magic potion worked!-and had been active in other ways too. The m ovie that had vaguely loom ed in her mind was, of course, by the time we watertreaded out of the dining room , forgotten. As we stood in the elevator, she leaned against me, faintly sm iling-wouldn't you like me to tel you-half closing her dark-lidded eyes. "Sleepy, huh?" said Uncle Tom who was bringing up the quiet Franco-Irish gentlem an and his daughter as wel as two withered women, experts in roses. They looked with sym pathy at my frail, tanned, tottering, dazed rosedarling. I had almost to carry her into our room . There, she sat down on the edge of the bed, swaying a little, speaking in dove-dul , long-drawn tones.

"If I tel you-if I tel you, wil you prom ise [sleepy, so sleepy-head lol ing, eyes going out], prom ise you won't make com plaints?"

"Later, Lo. Now go to bed. I'l leave you here, and you go to bed. Give you ten minutes."

"Oh, I've been such a disgusting girl," she went on, shaking her hair, rem oving with slow fingers a velvet hair ribbon. "Lemme tel you-"

"Tom orrow, Lo. Go to bed, go to bed-for goodness sake, to bed." I pocketed the key and walked downstairs.

28

Gentlewom en of the jury! Bear with me! Al ow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time. So this was le grand moment. I had left my Lolita stil sitting on the edge of the abysm al bed, drowsily raising her foot, fum bling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of her thigh up to the crotch of her panties-she had always been singularly absentminded, or sham eless, or both, in matters of legshow. This, then, was the hermetic vision of her which I had locked in-after satisfying myself that the door carried no inside bolt. The key, with its num bered dangler of carved wood, becam e forthwith the weighty sesam e to a rapturous and formidable future. It was mine, it was part of my hot hairy fist. In a few minutes-say, twenty, say half-an-hour, sicher its sicher as my uncle Gustave used to say-I would let myself into that "342" and find my nym phet, my beauty and bride, imprisoned in her crystal sleep. Jurors! If my happiness could have talked, it would have fil ed that genteel hotel with a deafening roar. And my only regret today is that I did not quietly deposit key "342" at the office, and leave the town, the country, the continent, the hem isphere,-indeed, the globe-that very sam e night. Let me explain. I was not unduly disturbed by her self-accusatory innuendoes. I was stil firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her purity by operating only in the stealth of night, only upon a com pletely anesthetized little nude. Restraint and reverence were stil my motto-even if that "purity" (incidental y, thoroughly debunked by m odern science) had been slightly dam aged through som e juvenile erotic experience, no doubt hom osexual, at that accursed cam p of hers. Of course, in my old-fashioned, old-world Page 60

way, I, Jean-Jacques Humbert, had taken for granted, when I first met her, that she was as unravished as the stereotypical notion of "normal child" had been since the lam ented end of the Ancient W orld B.C. and its fascinating practices. W e are not surrounded in our enlighted era by little slave flowers that can be casual y plucked between business and bath as they used to be in the days of the Rom ans; and we do not, as dignified Orientals did in stil more luxurious times, use tiny entertainers fore and aft between the mutton and the rose sherbet. The whole point is that the old link between the adult world and the child world has been com pletely severed nowadays by new custom s and new laws. Despite my having dabbled in psychiatry and social work, I real y knew very little about children. After al , Lolita was only twelve, and no matter what concessions I made to time and place-even bearing in mind the crude behavior of American schoolchildren-I stil was under the impression that whatever went on am ong those brash brats, went on at a later age, and in a different environm ent. Therefore (to retrieve the thread of this explanation) the moralist in me by-passed the issue by clinging to conventional notions of what twelve-year-old girls should be. The child therapist in me (a fake, as most of them are-but no matter) regurgitated neo-Freudian hash and conjured up a dream ing and exaggerating Dol y in the "latency" period of girlhood. Final y, the sensualist in me (a great and insane m onster) had no objection to som e depravity in his prey. But som ewhere behind the raging bliss, bewildered shadows conferred-and not to have heeded them , this is what I regret! Human beings, attend! I should have understood that Lolita had already proved to be som ething quite different from innocent Annabel, and that the nym phean evil breathing through every pore of the fey child that I had prepared for my secret delectation, would make the secrecy im possible, and the delectation lethal. I should have known (by the signs made to me by som ething in Lolita-the real child Lolita or som e haggard angel behind her back) that nothing but pain and horror would result from the expected rapture. Oh, winged gentlem en of the jury!

And she was mine, she was mine, the key was in my fist, my fist was in my pocket, she was mine. In the course of evocations and schem es to which I had dedicated so many insom nias, I had gradual y eliminated al the superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision, had evolved a final picture. Naked, except for one sock and her charm bracelet, spread-eagled on the bed where my philter had fel ed her-so I foreglimpsed her; a velvet hair ribbon was stil clutched in her hand; her honey-brown body, with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit patterned against her tan, presented to me its pale breastbuds; in the rosy lam plight, a little pubic floss glistened on its plum p hil ock. The cold key with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket. I wandered through various public room s, glory below, gloom above: for the look of lust always is gloom y; lust is never quite sure-even when the velvety victim is locked up in one's dungeon-that som e rival devil or influential god may stil not abolish one's prepared trium ph. In com m on parlance, I needed a drink; but there was no barroom in that venerable place ful of perspiring philistines and period objects. I drifted to the M en's Room . There, a person in the clerical black-a "hearty party" comme on dit-checking with the assistance of Vienna, if it was stil there, inquired of me how I had liked Dr. Boyd's talk, and looked puzzled when I (King Sigm und the Second) said Boyd was quite a boy. Upon which, I neatly chucked the tissue paper I had been wiping my sensitive finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it, and sal ied lobbyward. Com fortably resting my elbows on the counter, I asked M r. Potts was he quite sure my wife had not telephoned, and what about that cot? He answered she had not (she was dead, of course) and the cot would be instal ed tom orrow if we decided to stay on. From a big crowded place cal ed The Hunters' Hal cam e a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity. Another room , cal ed The Raspberry Room , al bathed in light, with bright little tables and a large one with "refreshm ents," was stil em pty Page 61

except for a hostess (that type of worn woman with a glassy sm ile and Charlotte's m anner of speaking); she floated up to me to ask if I was M r. Braddock, because if so, M

iss Beard had been looking for me. "W hat a nam e for a woman," I said and strol ed away. In and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood. I would give her til half-past-nine. Going back to the lobby, I found there a change: a num ber of people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and there, and som e elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of Lolita's age, in Lolita's type of frock, but pure white, and there was a white ribbon in her black hair. She was not pretty, but she was a nym phet, and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most pleasurable antiphony (in terms of spinal music) to my desire for Lolita, brown and pink, flushed and fouled. The pale child noticed my gaze (which was real y quite casual and debonair), and being ridiculously self-conscious, lost countenance com pletely, rol ing her eyes and putting the back of her hand to her cheek, and pul ing at the hem of her skirt, and final y turning her thin m obile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with her cowlike mother.

I left the loud lobby and stood outside, on the white steps, looking at the hundreds of powdered bugs wheeling around the lam ps in the soggy black night, ful of ripple and stir. Al I would do-al I would dare do-would am ount to such a trifle . . . Suddenly I was aware that in the darkness next to me there was som ebody sitting in a chair on the pil ared porch. I could not real y see him but what gave him away was the rasp of a screwing off, then a discreet gurgle, then the final note of a placid screwing on. I was about to m ove away when his voice addressed me:

"W here the devil did you get her?"

"I beg your pardon?"

"I said: the weather is getting better."

"Seem s so."

"W ho's the lassie?"

"M y daughter."

"You lie-she's not."

"I beg your pardon?"

"I said: July was hot. W here's her mother?"

"Dead."

"I see. Sorry. By the way, why don't you two lunch with me tom orrow. That dreadful crowd wil be gone by then."

"W e'l be gone too. Good night."

"Sorry. I'm pretty drunk. Good night. That child of yours needs a lot of sleep. Sleep is a rose, as the Persians say. Sm oke?"

"Not now."

He struck a light, but because he was drunk, or because the wind was, the flam e il um ined not him but another person, a very old man, one of those perm anent guests of old hotels-and his white rocker. Nobody said anything and the darkness returned to its initial place. Then I heard the old-timer cough and deliver himself of som e sepulchral mucus. I left the porch. At least half an hour in al had elapsed. I ought to have asked for a sip. The strain was beginning to tel . If a violin string can ache, then I was that string. But it would have been unseem ly to display any hurry. As I made my way through a constel ation of fixed people in one corner of the lobby, there cam e a blinding flash-and beam ing Dr. Braddock, two orchid-ornam entalized matrons, the sm al girl in white, and presum ably the bared teeth of Humbert Humbert sidling between the bridelike lassie and the enchanted cleric, were immortalized-insofar as the texture and print of sm al town newspapers can be deem ed immortal. A twittering group had gathered near the elevator. I Page 62

again chose the stairs. 342 was near the fire escape. One could stil -but the key was already in the lock, and then I was in the room .

29

The door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar; in addition to that, a skeleton glow cam e though the Venetian blind from the outside arclights; these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed the fol owing situation. Clothed in one of her old nightgowns, my Lolita lay on her side with her back to me, in the middle of the bed. Her lightly veiled body and bare limbs formed a Z. She had put both pil ows under her dark rousled head; a band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae. I seem ed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajam as with the kind of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinem atographic scene the process of changing is cut; and I had already placed my knee on the edge of the bed when Lolita turned her head and stared at me though the striped shadows.

Now this was som ething the intruder had not expected. The whole pil -spiel (a rather sordid affair, entre nous soit dit) had had for object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed, and here she was staring at me, and thickly cal ing me "Barbara." Barbara, wearing my pajam as which were much too tight for her, rem ained poised motionless over the little sleep-talker. Softly, with a hopeless sigh, Dol y turned away, resum ing her initial position. For at least two minutes I waited and strained on the brink, like that tailor with his hom em ade parachute forty years ago when about to jum p from the Eiffel Tower. Her faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep. Final y I heaved myself onto my narrow margin of bed, stealthily pul ed at the odds and ends of sheets piled up to the south of my stone-cold heels-and Lolita lifted her head and gaped at me. As I learned later from a helpful pharm aceutist, the purple pil did not even belong to the big and noble fam ily of barbiturates, and though it might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug, it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary, albeit weary, nym phet. W hether the Ram sdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd old rogue, does not, and did not, real y matter. W hat mattered, was that I had been deceived. W hen Lolita opened her eyes again, I realized that whether or not the drug might work later in the night, the security I had relied upon was a sham one. Slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair am ount of pil ow. I lay quite stil on my brink, peering at her rum pled hair, at the glimmer of nym phet flesh, where half a haunch and half a shoulder dimly showed, and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the rate of her respiration. Som e time passed, nothing changed, and I decided I might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and m addening glimmer; but hardly had I m oved into its warm purlieus than her breathing was suspended, and I had the odious feeling that little Dolores was wide awake and would explode in scream s if I touched her with any part of my wretchedness. Please, reader: no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted, morbidly sensitive, infinitely circum spect hero of my book, do not skip these essential pages! Imagine me; I shal not exist if you do not imagine me; try to discern the doe in me, trem bling in the forest of my own iniquity; let's even sm ile a little. After al , there is no harm in sm iling. For instance (I almost wrote

"frinstance"), I had no place to rest my head, and a fit of heartburn (they cal those fries

"French," grand Dieu!) was added to my discom fort.

She was again fast asleep, my nym phet, but stil I did not dare to launch upon my enchanted voyage. La Petite Dormeuse ou l'Amant Ridicule. Tom orrow I would stuff her with those earlier pil s that had so thoroughly num bed her mummy. In the glove com partment-or in the Gladstone bag? Should I wait a solid hour and then creep up again?

The science of nym pholepsy is a precise science. Actual contact would do it in one second flat. An interspace of a mil imeter would do it in ten. Let us wait. There is nothing louder than an American hotel; and, mind you, this was supposed to be a Page 63

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

quiet, cozy, old-fashioned, hom ey place-"gracious living" and al that stuff. The clatter of the elevator's gate-som e twenty yards northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left tem ple-alternated with the banging and boom ing of the m achine's various evolutions and lasted wel beyond midnight. Every now and then, immediately east of my left ear (always assum ing I lay on my back, not daring to direct my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bed-mate), the corridor would brim with cheerful, resonant and inept exclam ations ending in a vol ey of good-nights. W hen that stopped, a toilet immediately north of my cerebel um took over. It was a manly, energetic, deep-throated toilet, and it was used many times. Its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the wal behind me. Then som eone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick, almost coughing out his life with his liquor, and his toilet descended like a veritable Niagara, immediately beyond our bathroom . And when final y al the waterfal s had stopped, and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep, the avenue under the window of my insom nia, to the west of my wake-a staid, em inently residential, dignified al ey of huge trees-degenerated into the despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night.

And less than six inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous Lolita! After a long stirless vigil, my tentacles m oved towards her again, and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her. I m anaged to bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that I felt the aura of her bare shoulder like a warm breath upon my cheek. And then, she sat up, gasped, muttered with insane rapidity som ething about boats, tugged at the sheets and lapsed back into her rich, dark, young unconsciousness. As she tossed, within that abundant flow of sleep, recently auburn, at present lunar, her arm struck me across the face. For a second I held her. She freed herself from the shadow of my em brace-doing this not consciously, not violently, not with any personal distaste, but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a child dem anding its natural rest. And again the situation rem ained the sam e: Lolita with her curved spine to Humbert, Humbert resting his head on his hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia.

The latter necessitated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water which is the best medicine I know in my case, except perhaps milk with radishes; and when I re-entered the strange pale-striped fastness where Lolita's old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on pieces of furniture that seem ed vaguely afloat, my im possible daughter sat up and in clear tones dem anded a drink, too. She took the resilient and cold paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contents grateful y, her long eyelashes pointing cupward, and then, with an infantile gesture that carried more charm than any carnal caress, little Lolita wiped her lips against my shoulder. She fel back on her pil ow (I had subtracted mine while she drank) and was instantly asleep again. I had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug, and had not abandoned hope that the first might stil consolidate her sleep. I started to m ove toward her, ready for any disappointment, knowing I had better wait but incapable of waiting. M y pil ow sm el ed of her hair. I m oved toward my glimmering darling, stopping or retreating every time I thought she stirred or was about to stir. A breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my thoughts, and now they seem ed couched in italics, as if the surface reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze. Time and again my consciousness folded the wrong way, my shuffling body entered the sphere of sleep, shuffled out again, and once or twice I caught myself drifting into a melancholy snore. M ists of tenderness enfolded m ountains of longing. Now and then it seem ed to me that the enchanted prey was about to m eet halfway the enchanted hunter, that her haunch was working its way toward me under the soft sand of a rem ote and fabulous beach; and then her dimpled dim ness would stir, and I would know she was farther away from me than ever. If I dwel at som e length on the trem ors and groupings of that distant night, it is because I Page 64

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

insist upon proving that I am not, and never was, and never could have been, a brutal scoundrel. The gentle and dream y regions though which I crept were the patrim onies of poets-not crime's prowling ground. Had I reached my goal, my ecstasy would have been al softness, a case of internal com bustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat, even if she were wide awake. But I stil hoped she might gradual y be engulfed in a com pleteness of stupor that would al ow me to taste more than a glimmer of her. And so, in between tentative approximations, with a confusion of perception metam orphosing her into eyespots of m oonlight or a fluffy flowering bush, I would dream I regained consciousness, dream I lay in wait.

In the first antem eridian hours there was a lul in the restless hotel night. Then around four the corridor toilet cascaded and its door banged. A little after five a reverberating m onologue began to arrive, in several instal ments, from som e courtyard or parking place. It was not real y a m onologue, since the speaker stopped every few seconds to listen (presum ably) to another fel ow, but that other voice did not reach me, and so no real m eaning could be derived from the part heard. Its matter-of-fact intonations, however, helped to bring in the dawn, and the room was already suffused with lilac gray, when several industrious toilets went to work, one after the other, and the clattering and whining elevator began to rise and take down early risers and downers, and for som e minutes I miserably dozed, and Charlotte was a mermaid in a greenish tank, and som ewhere in the passage Dr. Boyd said "Good morning to you" in a fruity voice, and birds were busy in the trees, and then Lolita yawned.

Frigid gentlewom en of the jury! I had thought that m onths, perhaps years, would elapse before I dared to reveal myself to Dolores Haze; but by six she was wide awake, and by six fifteen we were technical y lovers. I am going to tel you som ething very strange: it was she who seduced me.

Upon hearing her first morning yawn, I feigned handsom e profiled sleep. I just did not know what to do. W ould she be shocked at finding me by her side, and not in som e spare bed? W ould she col ect her clothes and lock herself up in the bathroom ? W ould she dem and to be taken at once to Ram sdale-to her mother's bedside-back to cam p?

But my Lo was a sportive lassie. I felt her eyes on me, and when she uttered at last that beloved chortling note of hers, I knew her eyes had been laughing. She rol ed over to my side, and her warm brown hair cam e against my col arbone. I gave a mediocre imitation of waking up. W e lay quietly. I gently caressed her hair, and we gently kissed. Her kiss, to my delirious em barrassm ent, had som e rather com ical refinem ents of flutter and probe which made me conclude she had been coached at an early age by a little Lesbian. No Charlie boy could have taught her that. As if to see whether I had my fil and learned the lesson, she drew away and surveyed me. Her cheekbones were flushed, her ful underlip glistened, my dissolution was near. Al at once, with a burst of rough glee (the sign of the nym phet!), she put her m outh to my ear-but for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of her whisper, and she laughed, and brushed the hair off her face, and tried again, and gradual y the odd sense of living in a brand new, mad new dream world, where everything was permissible, cam e over me as I realized what she was suggesting. I answered I did not know what gam e she and Charlie had played.

"You m ean you have never-?"-her features twisted into a stare of disgusted incredulity.

"You have never-" she started again. I took time out by nuzzling her a little.

"Lay off, wil you," she said with a twangy whine, hastily rem oving her brown shoulder from my lips. (It was very curious the way she considered-and kept doing so for a long time-al caresses except kisses on the m outh or the stark act of love either "rom antic slosh" or "abnormal".)

"You m ean," she persisted, now kneeling above me, "you never did it when you were a kid?"

Page 65

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"Never," I answered quite truthful y.

"Okay," said Lolita, "here is where we start." However, I shal not bore my learned readers with a detailed account of Lolita's presum ption. Suffice it to say that not a trace of m odesty did I perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom m odern coeducation, juvenile mores, the cam pfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved. She saw the stark act merely as part of a youngster's furtive world, unknown to adults. W hat adults did for purposes of procreation was no business of hers. M y life was handled by little Lo in an energetic, matter-of-fact m anner as if it were an insensate gadget unconnected with me. W hile eager to impress me with the world of tough kids, she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies between a kid's life and mine. Pride alone prevented her from giving up; for, in my strange predicam ent, I feigned suprem e stupidity and had her have her way-at least while I could stil bear it. But real y these are irrelevant matters; I am not concerned with so-cal ed "sex" at al . Anybody can imagine those elem ents of animality. A greater endeavor lures me on: to fix once for al the perilous magic of nym phets. 30

I have to tread careful y. I have to speak in a whisper. Oh you, veteran crime reporter, you grave old usher, you once popular policem an, now in solitary confinem ent after gracing that school crossing for years, you wretched em eritus read to by a boy! It would never do, would it, to have you fel ows fal madly in love with my Lolita! had I been a painter, had the management of The Enchanted Hunters lost its mind one summer day and commissioned me to redecorate their dining room with murals of my own making, this is what I might have thought up, let me list som e fragm ents: There would have been a lake. There would have been an arbor in flam e-flower. There would have been nature studiesa tiger pursuing a bird of paradise, a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat. There would have been a sultan, his face expressing great agony (belied, as it were, by his molding caress), helping a cal ypygean slave child to climb a colum n of onyx. There would have been those lum inous globules of gonadal glow that travel up the opalescent sides of juke boxes. There would have been al kinds of cam p activities on the part of the intermediate group, Canoeing, Coranting, Com bing Curls in the lakeside sun. There would have been poplars, apples, a suburban Sunday. There would have been a fire opal dissolving within a ripple-ringed pool, a last throb, a last dab of color, stinging red, sm earing pink, a sigh, a wincing child. 31

I am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless misery, but to sort out the portion of hel and the portion of heaven in that strange, awful, m addening world-nym phet love. The beastly and beautiful merged at one point, and it is that borderline I would like to fix, and I feel I fail to do so utterly. W hy?

The stipulation of the Rom an law, according to which a girl may marry at twelve, was adopted by the Church, and is stil preserved, rather tacitly, in som e of the United States. And fifteen is lawful everywhere. There is nothing wrong, say both hem ispheres, when a brute of forty, blessed by the local priest and bloated with drink, sheds his sweatdrenched finery and thrusts himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride. "In such stimulating tem perate climates [says an old magazine in this prison library] as St. Louis, Chicago and Cincinnati, girls mature about the end of their twelfth year." Dolores Haze was born less than three hundred miles from stimulating Cincinnati. I have but fol owed nature. I am nature's faithful hound. W hy then this horror that I cannot shake off? Did I deprive her of her flower? Sensitive gentlewom en of the jury, I was not even her first lover.

She told me the way she had been debauched. W e ate flavorless m ealy bananas, bruised Page 66

peaches and very palatable potato chips, and die Lleine told me everything. Her voluble but disjointed account was accom panied by many a drol m oue. As I think I have already observed, I especial y rem em ber one wry face on an "ugh!" basis: jel y-m outh distended sideways and eyes rol ed up in a routine blend of com ic disgust, resignation and tolerance for young frailty.

Her astounding tale started with an introductory mention of her tent-mate of the previous summer, at another cam p, a "very select" one as she put it. That tent-mate ("quite a derelict character," "half-crazy," but a "swel kid") instructed her in various manipulations. At first, loyal Lo refused to tel me her nam e.

"W as it Grace Angel?" I asked.

She shook her head. No, it wasn't it was the daughter of a big shot. He-"W as it perhaps Rose Carmine?"

"No, of course not. Her father-"

"W as it, then, Agnes Sheridan perchance?"

She swal owed and shook her head-and then did a double take.

"Say, how com e you know al those kids?"

I explained.

"W el ," she said. "They are pretty bad, som e of that school bunch, but not that bad. If you have to know, her nam e was Elizabeth Talbot, she goes now to a swanky private school, her father is an executive."

I recal ed with a funny pang the frequency with which poor Charlotte used to introduce into party chat such elegant tidbits as "when my daughter was out hiking last year with the Talbot girl."

I wanted to know if either mother learned of those sapphic diversions?

"Gosh no," exhaled limp Lo mimicking dread and relief, pressing a falsely fluttering hand to her chest.

I was more interested, however, in heterosexual experience. She had entered the sixth grade at eleven, soon after m oving to Ram sdale from the M iddle W est. W hat did she m ean by "pretty bad"?

W el , the M iranda twins had shared the sam e bed for years, and Donald Scott, who was the dum best boy in the school, had done it with Hazel Sm ith in his uncle's garage, and Kenneth Knight-who was the brightest-used to exhibit himself wherever and whenever he had a chance, and-"Let us switch to Cam p Q," I said. And presently I got the whole story. Barbara Burke, a sturdy blond, two years older than Lo and by far the cam p's best swimmer, had a very special canoe which she shared with Lo "because I was the only other girl who could make W il ow Island" (som e swimming test, I imagine). Through July, every morning-m ark, reader, every blessed morning-Barbara and Lo would be helped to carry the boat to Onyx or Eryx (two sm al lakes in the wood) by Charlie Holmes, the cam p mistress' son, aged thirteen-and the only hum an male for a couple of miles around (excepting an old m eek stone-deaf handym an, and a farmer in an old Ford who som etimes sold the cam pers eggs as farmers wil ); every morning, oh my reader, the three children would take a short cut through the beautiful innocent forest brimming with al the em blem s of youth, dew, birdsongs, and at one point, am ong the luxuriant undergrowth, Lo would be left as sentinel, while Barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush.

At first, Lo had refused "to try what it was like," but curiosity and cam araderie prevailed, and soon she and Barbara were doing it by turns with the silent, coarse and surly but indefatigable Charlie, who had as much sex appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating col ection of contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake, a considerably larger and more populous one, cal ed Lake Climax, after the boom ing young Page 67

factory town of that nam e. Although conceding it was "sort of fun" and "fine for the com plexion," Lolita, I am glad to say, held Charlie's mind and m anners in the greatest contem pt. Nor had her tem peram ent been roused by that filthy fiend. In fact, I think he had rather stunned it, despite the "fun."

By that time it was close to ten. W ith the ebb of lust, an ashen sense of awfulness, abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgic day, crept over me and hum m ed within my tem ples. Brown, naked, frail Lo, her narrow white buttocks to me, her sulky face to a door mirror, stood, arms akim bo, feet (in new slippers with pussy-fur tops) wide apart, and through a forechanging lock tritely m ugged at herself in the glass. From the corridor cam e the cooing voices of colored maids at work, and presently there was a mild attem pt to open the door of our room . I had Lo go to the bathroom and take a much-needed soap shower. The bed was a frightful m ess with overtones of potato chips. She tried on a twopiece navy wool, then a sleeveless blouse with a swirly clathrate skirt, but the first was too tight and the second too am ple, and when I begged her to hurry up (the situation was beginning to frighten me), Lo viciously sent those nice presents of mine hurtling into a corner, and put on yesterday's dress. W hen she was ready at last, I gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf (in which I had slipped quite a few pennies and two mint-bright dimes) and told her to buy herself a magazine in the lobby.

"I'l be down in a minute," I said. "And if I were you, my dear, I would not talk to strangers." Except for my poor little gifts, there was not much to pack; but I was forced to devote a dangerous am ount of time (was she up to som ething downstairs?) to arranging the bed in such a way as to suggest the abandoned nest of a restless father and his tom boy daughter, instead of an ex-convict's saturnalia with a couple of fat old whores. Then I finished dressing and had the hoary bel boy com e up for the bags.

Everything was fine. There, in the lobby, she sat, deep in an overstuffed blood-red armchair, deep in a lurid m ovie magazine. A fel ow of my age in tweeds (the genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious country-squire atm osphere) was staring at my Lolita over his dead cigar and stale newspaper. She wore her professional white socks and saddle oxfords, and that bright print frock with the square throat; a splash of jaded lam plight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs. There she sat, her legs carelessly highcrossed, and her pale eyes skimming along the lines with every now and then a blink. Bil 's wife had worshipped him from afar long before they ever met: in fact, she used to secretly adm ire the fam ous young actor as he ate sundaes in Schwab's drugstore. Nothing could have been more childish than her snubbed nose, freckled face or the purplish spot on her naked neck where a fairytale vam pire had feasted, or the unconscious m ovem ent of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her swol en lips; nothing could be more harmless than to read about Jil , an energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious literature; nothing could be more innocent than the part in that glossy brown hair with that silky sheen on the tem ple; nothing could be more naive-But what sickening envy the lecherous fel ow whoever he was-come to think of it, he resem bled a little my Swiss uncle Gustave, also a great adm irer of le dÃ©couvert-would have experienced had he known that every nerve in me was stil anointed and ringed with the feel of her body-the body of som e immortal dem on disguised as a fem ale child.

W as pink pig M r. Swoon absolutely sure my wife had not telephoned? He was. If she did, would he tel her we had gone on to Aunt Clare's place? He would, indeedie. I settled the bil and roused Lo from her chair. She read to the car. Stil reading, she was driven to a so-cal ed coffee shop a few blocks south. Oh, she ate al right. She even laid aside her magazine to eat, but a queer dul ness had replaced her usual cheerfulness. I knew little Lo could be very nasty, so I braced myself and grinned, and waited for a squal . I was Page 68

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

unbathed, unshaven, and had had no bowel m ovem ent. M y nerves were a-jangle. I did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her shoulders and distended her nostrils when I attem pted casual sm al talk. Had Phyl is been in the know before she joined her parents in M aine? I asked with a sm ile. "Look," said Lo making a weeping grim ace,

"let us get off the subject." I then tried-also unsuccessful y, no matter how I sm acked my lips-to interest her in the road map. Our destination was, let me rem ind my patient reader whose m eek tem per Lo ought to have copied, the gay town of Lepingvil e, som ewhere near a hypothetical hospital. That destination was in itself a perfectly arbitrary one (as, alas, so many were to be), and I shook in my shoes as I wondered how to keep the whole arrangem ent plausible, and what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in al the m ovies in Lepingvil e. M ore and more uncom fortable did Humbert Feel. It was som ething quite special, that feeling: an oppressive, hideous constraint as if I were sitting with the sm al ghost of som ebody I had just kil ed. As she was in the act of getting back into the car, an expression of pain flitted across Lo's face. It flitted again, more m eaningful y, as she settled down beside me. No doubt, she reproduced it that second time for my benefit. Foolishly, I asked her what was the matter.

"Nothing, you brute," she replied. "You what?" I asked. She was silent. Leaving Briceland. Loquacious Lo was silent. Cold spiders of panic crawled down my back. This was an orphan. This was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a heavy-limbed, foulsm el ing adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very morning. W hether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed al expectation, it had, in a sense, overshot its mark-and plunged into a nightmare. I had been careless, stupid, and ignoble. And let me be quite frank: som ewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil I felt the writhing of desire again, so m onstrous was my appetite for that miserable nym phet. M

ingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing through that her m ood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as I found a nice country road where to park in peace. In other words, poor Humbert Humbert was dreadful y unhappy, and while steadily and inanely driving toward Lepingvil e, he kept racking his brains for som e quip, under the bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seatmate. It was she, however, who broke the silence:

"Oh, a squashed squirrel," she said. "W hat a sham e."

"Yes, isn't it?" (eager, hopeful Hum).

"Let us stop at the next gas station," Lo continued. "I want to go to the washroom ."

"W e shal stop wherever you want," I said. And then as a lovely, lonely, supercilious grove (oaks, I thought; American trees at that stage were beyond me) started to echo greenly the rush of our car, a red and ferny road on our right turned its head before slanting into the woodland, and I suggested we might perhaps-"Drive on," my Lo cried shril y.

"Righto. Take it easy." (Down, poor beast, down.)

I glanced at her. Thank God, the child was sm iling.

"You chum p," she said, sweetly sm iling at me. "You revolting creature. I was a daisyfresh girl, and look what you've done to me. I ought to cal the police and tel them you raped me. Oh, you dirty, dirty old man."

W as she just joking? An om inous hysterical note rang through her sil y words. Presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips, she started com plaining of pains, said she could not sit, said I had torn som ething inside her. The sweat rol ed down my neck, and we almost ran over som e little animal or other that was crossing the road with tail erect, and again my vile-tem pered com panion cal ed me an ugly nam e. W hen we stopped at the fil ing station, she scram bled out without a word and was a long time away. Slowly, lovingly, an elderly friend with a broken nose wiped my windshield-they do it differently at every place, from cham ois cloth to soapy brush, this fel ow used a pink Page 69

sponge.

She appeared at last. "Look," she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so, "give me som e dimes and nickels. I want to cal mother in that hospital. W hat's the num ber?"

"Get in," I said. "You can't cal that num ber."

"W hy?"

"Get in and slam the door."

She got in and slammed the door. The old garage man beam ed at her. I swung onto the highway.

"W hy can't I cal my mother if I want to?"

"Because," I answered, "your mother is dead." 33

In the gay town of Lepingvil e I bought her four books of com ics, a box of candy, a box of sanitary pads, two cokes, a manicure set, a travel clock with a lum inous dial, a ring with a real topaz, a tennis racket, rol er skates with white high shoes, field glasses, a portable radio set, chewing gum , a transparent raincoat, sunglasses, som e more garmentsswooners, shorts, al kinds of summer frocks. At the hotel we had separate room s, but in the middle of the night she cam e sobbing into mine, and we made it up very gently. You see, she had absolutely nowhere else to go.

* PART TW O *

1

It was then that began our extensive travels al over the States. To any other type of tourist accom m odation I soon grew to prefer the Functional M otel-clean, neat, safe nooks, ideal places for sleep, argum ent, reconciliation, insatiable il icit love. At first, in my dread of arousing suspicion, I would eagerly pay for both sections of one double unit, each containing a double bed. I wondered what type of foursom e this arrangem ent was even intended for, since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be attained by m eans of the incom plete partition dividing the cabin or room into two com m unicating love nests. By and by, the very possibilities that such honest prom iscuity suggested (two young couples merrily swapping mates or a child shamming sleep to earwitness primal sonorities) made me bolder, and every now and then I would take a bed-and-cot or twinbed cabin, a prison cel or paradise, with yel ow window shades pul ed down to create a morning il usion of Venice and sunshine when actual y it was Pennsylvania and rain. W e cam e to know-nous connÃ»m es, to use a Flaubertian intonation-the stone cottages under enorm ous Chateaubriandesque trees, the brick unit, the adobe unit, the stucco court, on what the Tour Book of the Autom obile Association describes as "shaded" or

"spacious" or "landscaped" grounds. The log kind, finished in knotty pine, rem inded Lo, by its golden-brown glaze, of friend-chicken bones. W e held in contem pt the plain whitewashed clapboard Kabins, with their faint sewerish sm el or som e other gloom y self-conscious stench and nothing to boast of (except "good beds"), and an unsm iling landlady always prepared to have her gift (". . . wel , I could give you . . .") turned down. Nous connÃ»m es (this is royal fun) the would-be enticem ents of their repetitious nam es-al those Sunset M otels, U-Beam Cottages, Hil crest Courts, Pine View Courts, M

ountain View Courts, Skyline Courts, Park Plaza Courts, Green Acres, M ac's Courts. There was som etimes a special line in the write-up, such as "Children welcom e, pets al owed" (You are welcom e, you are al owed). The baths were mostly tiled showers, with an endless variety of spouting m echanism s, but with one definitely non-Laodicean characteristic in com m on, a propensity, while in use, to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you, depending on whether your neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary com plem ent in the shower you had so careful y blended. Som e motels had instructions pasted above the toilet (on whose tank the towels were unhygienical y heaped) asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage, beer cans, cartons, stil born Page 70

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

babies; others had special notices under glass, such as Things to Do (Riding: You wil often see riders com ing down M ain Street on their way back from a rom antic m oonlight ride. "Often at 3 a.m.," sneered unrom antic Lo). Nous connÃ»m es the various types of motor court operators, the reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop, am ong the males; and the motherly, pseudoladylike and madamic variants am ong the fem ales. And som etimes trains would cry in the m onstrously hot and hum id night with heartrending and om inous plangency, mingling power and hysteria in one desperate scream .

W e avoided Tourist Homes, country cousins of Funeral ones, old-fashioned, genteel and showerless, with elaborate dressing tables in depressingly white-and-pink little bedroom s, and photographs of the landlady's children in al their instars. But I did surrender, now and then, to Lo's predilection for "real" hotels. She would pick out in the book, while I petted her in the parked car in the silence of a dusk-mel owed, mysterious side-road, som e highly recom m ended lake lodge which offered al sorts of things magnified by the flashlight she m oved over them , such as congenial com pany, between-m eals snacks, outdoor barbecues-but which in my mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts and an em ber-red cheek pressing against hers, while poor Dr. Humbert, em bracing nothing but two masculine knees, would cold-hum or his piles on the dam p turf. M ost em pty to her, too, were those "Colonial" Inns, which apart from

"gracious atm osphere" and picture windows, prom ised "unlimited quantities of M -m-m food." Treasured recol ections of my father's palatial hotel som etimes led me to seek for its like in the strange country we traveled through. I was soon discouraged; but Lo kept fol owing the scent of rich food ads, while I derived a not exclusively econom ic kick from such roadside signs as Timber Hotel, Children under 14 Free. On the other hand, I shudder when recal ing that soi-disant "high-class" resort in a M idwestern state, which advertised "raid-the-icebox" midnight snacks and, intrigued by my accent, wanted to know my dead wife's and dead mother's maiden nam es. A two-days' stay there cost me a hundred and twenty-four dol ars! And do you rem em ber, M iranda, that other "ultrasm art" robbers' den with com plimentary morning coffee and circulating ice water, and no children under sixteen (no Lolitas, of course)?

Immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which becam e our habitual haunts, she would set the electric fan a-whirr, or induce me to drop a quarter into the radio, or she would read al the signs and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up som e advertised trail or swimming in that local pool of warm mineral water. M

ost often, in the slouching, bored way she cultivated, Lo would fal prostrate and abom inably desirable into a red springchair or a green chaise longue, or a steam er chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy, or a sling chair, or any other lawn chair under a garden um brel a on the patio, and it would take hours of blandishm ents, threats and prom ises to make her lend me for a few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the five-dol ar room before undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy. A com bination of naÃ¯vetÃ© and deception, of charm and vulgarity, of blue silks and rosy mirth, Lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating brat. I was not real y quite prepared for her fits of disorganized boredom , intense and vehem ent griping, her sprawling, droopy, dopey-eyed style, and what is cal ed goofing off-a kind of diffused clowning which she thought was tough in a boyish hoodlum way. M ental y, I found her to be a disgustingly conventional little girl. Sweet hot jazz, square dancing, gooey fudge sundaes, musicals, m ovie magazines and so forth-these were the obvious item s in her list of beloved things. The Lord knows how many nickels I fed to the gorgeous music boxes that cam e with every m eal we had! I stil hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her, people with nam es like Sammy and Jo and Eddy and Tony and Peggy and Guy and Patty and Rex, and sentimental song hits, al of them as similar to my ear as her Page 71

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

various candies were to my palate. She believed, with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisem ent or advice that that appeared in M ovie Love or Screen Land-Starasil Starves Pimples, or "You better watch out if you're wearing your shirttails outside your jeans, gals, because Jil says you shouldn't." If a roadside sign said: Visit Our Gift Shopwe had to visit it, had to buy its Indian curios, dol s, copper jewelry, cactus candy. The words "novelties and souvenirs" simply entranced her by their trochaic lilt. If som e cafÃ©

sign proclaimed Icecold Drinks, she was autom atical y stirred, although al drinks everywhere were ice-cold. She it was to whom ads were dedicated: the ideal consum er, the subject and object of every foul poster. And she attem pted-unsuccessful y-to patronize only those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads. In those days, neither she nor I had thought up yet the system of m onetary bribes which was to work such havoc with my nerves and her morals som ewhat later. I relied on three other methods to keep my pubescent concubine in subm ission and passable tem per. A few years before, she had spent a rainy summer under M iss Phalen's bleary eye in a dilapidated Appalachian farm house that had belonged to som e gnarled Haze or other in the dead past. It stil stood am ong its rank acres of golden rod on the edge of a flowerless forest, at the end of a perm anently m uddy road, twenty miles from the nearest ham let. Lo recal ed that scarecrow of a house, the solitude, the soggy old pastures, the wind, the bloated wilderness, with an energy of disgust that distorted her m outh and fattened her half-revealed tongue. And it was there that I warned her she would dwel with me in exile for m onths and years if need be, studying under me French and Latin, unless her

"present attitude" changed. Charlotte, I began to understand you!

A simple child, Lo would scream no! and frantical y clutch at my driving hand whenever I put a stop to her tornadoes of tem per by turning in the middle of a highway with the implication that I was about to take her straight to that dark and dism al abode. The farther, however, we traveled away from it west, the less tangible that m enace becam e, and I had to adopt other methods of persuasion.

Am ong these, the reformatory threat is the one I recal with the deepest moan of sham e. From the very beginning of our concourse, I was clever enough to realize that I must secure her com plete co-operation in keeping our relations secret, that it should becom e a second nature with her, no matter what grudge she might bear me, no matter what other pleasure she might seek.

"Com e and kiss your old man," I would say, "and drop that m oody nonsense. In former times, when I was stil your dream male [the reader wil notice what pains I took to speak Lo's tongue], you swooned to records of the num ber one throb-and-sob idol of your coevals [Lo: "Of my what? Speak English"]. That idol of your pals sounded, you thought, like friend Humbert. But now, I am just your old man, a dream dad protecting his dream daughter.

"M y chÃ©re DolorÃ©s! I want to protect you, dear, from al the horrors that happen to little girls in coal sheds and al ey ways, and alas, comme vous le savez trop bien, ma gentil e, in the blueberry woods during the bluest of summers. Through thick and thin I wil stil stay your guardian, and if you are good, I hope a court may legalize that guardianship before long. Let us, however, forget, Dolores Haze, so-cal ed legal terminology, terminology that accepts as rational the term 'lewd and lascivious cohabitation.' I am not a criminal sexual psychopath taking indecent liberties with a child. The rapist was Charlie Holmes; I am the therapist-a matter of nice spacing in the way of distinction. I am your daddum , Lo. Look, I've a learned book here about young girls. Look, darling, what it says. I quote: the normal girl-normal, mark you-the normal girl is usual y extrem ely anxious to please her father. She feels in him the forerunner of the desired elusive male ('elusive' is good, by Polonius!). The wise mother (and your poor mother would have Page 72

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

been wise, had she lived) wil encourage a com panionship between father and daughter, realizing-excuse the corny style-that the girl forms her ideals of rom ance and of men from her association with her father. Now, what association does this cheery book m ean-and recom m end? I quote again: Am ong Sicilians sexual relations between a father and his daughter are accepted as a matter of course, and the girl who participates in such relationship is not looked upon with disapproval by the society of which she is part. I'm a great adm irer of Sicilians, fine athletes, fine musicians, fine upright people, Lo, and great lovers. But let's not digress. Only the other day we read in the newspapers som e bunkum about a middle-aged morals offender who pleaded guilty to the violation of the M ann Act and to transporting a nine-year-old girl across state lines for immoral purposes, whatever these are. Dolores darling! You are not nine but almost thirteen, and I would not advise you to consider yourself my cross-country slave, and I deplore the M ann Act as lending itself to a dreadful pun, the revenge that the Gods of Sem antics take against tight-zippered Philistines. I am your father, and I am speaking English, and I love you.

"Final y, let us see what happens if you, a minor, accused of having impaired the morals of an adult in a respectable inn, what happens if you com plain to the police of my having kidnapped and raped you? Let us suppose they believe you. A minor fem ale, who al ows a person over twenty-one to know her carnal y, involves her victim into statutory rape, or second-degree sodom y, depending on the technique; and the maximum penalty is ten years. So, I go to jail. Okay. I go to jail. But what happens to you, my orphan? W el , you are luckier. You becom e the ward of the Department of Public W elfare-which I am afraid sounds a little bleak. A nice grim matron of the M iss Phalen type, but more rigid and not a drinking woman, wil take away your lipstick and fancy clothes. No more gadding about! I don't know if you have ever heard of the laws relating to dependent, neglected, incorrigible and delinquent children. W hile I stand gripping the bars, you, happy neglected child, wil be given a choice of various dwel ing places, al more or less the sam e, the correctional school, the reformatory, the juvenile detention hom e, or one of those adm irable girls' protectories where you knit things, and sing hym ns, and have rancid pancakes on Sundays. You wil go there, Lolita-m y Lolita, this Lolita wil leave plainer words, if we two are found out, you wil be analyzed and institutionalized, my pet, c'est tout. You wil dwel , my Lolita wil dwel (com e here, my brown flower) with thirty-nine other dopes in a dirty dormitory (no, al ow me, please) under the supervision of hideous matrons. This is the situation, this is the choice. Don't you think that under the circum stances Dolores Haze had better stick to her old man?" By rubbing al this in, I succeeded in terrorizing Lo, who despite a certain brash alertness of m anner and spurts of wit was not as intel igent a child as her I.Q. might suggest. But if I m anaged to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt, I was much less successful in keeping her in good hum or. Every morning during our yearlong travels I had to devise som e expectation, som e special point in space and time for her to look forward to, for her to survive til bedtime. Otherwise, deprived of a shaping and sustaining purpose, the skeleton of her day sagged and col apsed. The object in view might be anything-a lighthouse in Virginia, a natural cave in Arkansas converted to a cafÃ©, a col ection of guns and violins som ewhere in Oklahom a, a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes in Louisiana, shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the local museum of a Rocky M ountains resort, anything whatsoever-but it had to be there, in front of us, like a fixed star, although as likely as not Lo would feign gagging as soon as we got to it.

By putting the geography of the United States into motion, I did my best for hours on end to give her the impression of "going places," of rol ing on to som e definite destination, to som e unusual delight. I have never seen such sm ooth am iable roads as those that now radiated before us, across the crazy quilt of forty-eight states. Voraciously we consum ed Page 73

those long highways, in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance floors. Not only had Lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resented my cal ing her attention to this or that enchanting detail of landscape; which I myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey. By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland NorthAmerican countryside had at first seem ed to me som ething I accepted with a shock of am used recognition because of those painted oilclothes which were im ported from America in the old days to be hung above washstands in Central-European nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views they depicted-opaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the dul white of vague orchards in bloom , and perhaps a stone fence or hil s of greenish gouache. But gradual y the m odels of those elem entary rusticities becam e stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer I cam e to know them . Beyond the til ed plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeled-peach tinge pervading the upper edge of a two-dimensional, dove-gray cloud fusing with the distant am orous mist. There might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot stil noons above a wilderness of clover, and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed rem otely into misty azure with only their cum ulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. Or again, it might be a stern El Greco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of som e mummy-necked farmer, and al around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harsh green corn, the whole arrangem ent opening like a fan, som ewhere in Kansas.

Now and then, in the vastness of those plains, huge trees would advance toward us to cluster self-consciously by the roadside and provide a bit of hum anitarian shade above a picnic table, with sun flecks, flattened paper cups, sam aras and discarded ice-cream sticks littering the brown ground. A great user of roadside facilities, my unfastidious Lo would be charmed by toilet signs-Guys-Gals, John-Jane, Jack-Jil and even Buck'sDoe's; while lost in an artist's dream , I would stare at the honest brightness of the gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks, or at a distant hil scram bling out-scarred but stil untam ed-from the wilderness of agriculture that was trying to swal ow it.

At night, tal trucks studded with colored lights, like dreadful giant Christmas trees, loom ed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little sedan. And again next day a thinly populated sky, losing its blue to the heat, would melt overhead, and Lo would clam or for a drink, and her cheeks would hol ow vigorously over the straw, and the car inside would be a furnace when we got in again, and the road shimmered ahead, with a rem ote car changing its shape mirage-like in the surface glare, and seem ing to hang for a moment, old-fashionedly square and high, in the hot haze. And as we pushed westward, patches of what the garage-man cal ed "sage brush" appeared, and then the mysterious outlines of table-like hil s, and then red bluffs ink-blotted with junipers, and then a m ountain range, dun grading into blue, and blue into dream , and the desert would m eet us with a steady gale, dust, gray thorn bushes, and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers am ong the prickles of wind-tortured withered stalks al along the highway; in the middle o which there som etimes stood simple cows, im m obilized in a position (tail left, white eyelashes right) cutting across al hum an rules of traffic. M y lawyer has suggested I give a clear, frank account of the itinerary we fol owed, and I suppose I have reached here a point where I cannot avoid that chore. Roughly, during that mad year (August 1947 to August 1948), our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in New England, then m eandered south, up and down, east and west; dipped deep into ce qu'on appel e Dixieland, avoided Florida because the Farlows were there, veered west, zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts (this is not too clear I am afraid, Page 74

Clarence, but I did not keep any notes, and have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volum es, almost a sym bol of my torn and tattered past, in which to check these recol ections); crossed and recrossed the Rockies, straggled through southern deserts where we wintered; reached the Pacific, turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads; almost reached the Canadian border; and proceeded east, across good lands and bad lands, back to agriculture on a grand scale, avoiding, despite little Lo's strident rem onstrations, little Lo's birthplace, in a corn, coal and hog producing area; and final y returned to the fold of the East, petering out in the col ege town of Beardsley.

Now, in perusing what fol ows, the reader should bear in mind not only the general circuit as adum brated above, with its many sidetrips and tourist traps, secondary circles and skittish deviations, but also the fact that far from being an indolent partie de plaisir, our tour was a hard, twisted, teleological growth, whose sole raison d'Ã©tre (these French clichÃ©s are sym ptom atic) was to keep my com panion in passable hum or from kiss to kiss. Thum bing through that battered tour book, I dimly evoke that M agnolia Garden in a southern state which cost me four bucks and which, according to the ad in the book, you must visit for three reasons: because John Galsworthy (a stone-dead writer of sorts) acclaimed it as the world's fairest garden; because in 1900 Baedeker's Guide had marked it with a star; and final y, because . . . O, Reader, M y Reader, guess! . . . because children (and by Jingo was not my Lolita a child!) wil "walk starry-eyed and reverently through this foretaste of Heaven, drinking in beauty that can influence a life."

"Not mine," said grim Lo, and settled down on a bench with the fil ings of two Sunday papers in her lovely lap.

W e passed and re-passed through the whole gam ut of American roadside restaurants, from the lowly Eat with its deer head (dark trace of long tear at inner canthus),

"hum orous" picture post cards of the posterior "Kurort" type, impaled guest checks, life savers, sunglasses, adm an visions of celestial sundaes, one half of a chocolate cake under glass, and several horribly experienced flies zigzagging over the sticky sugar-pour on the ignoble counter; and al the way to the expensive place with the subdued lights, preposterously poor table linen, inept waiters (ex-convicts or col ege boys), the roan back of a screen actress, the sable eyebrows of her male of the moment, and an orchestra of zoot-suiters with trum pets.

W e inspected the world's largest stalagm ite in a cave where three southeastern states have a fam ily reunion; adm ission by age; adults one dol ar, pubescents sixty cents. A granite obelisk commemorating the Battle of Blue Licks, with old bones and Indian pottery in the museum nearby, Lo a dime, very reasonable. The present log cabin boldly simulating the past log cabin where Lincoln was born. A boulder, with a plaque, in memory of the author of "Trees" (by now we are in Poplar Cove, N.C., reached by what my kind, tolerant, usual y so restrained tour book angrily cal s "a very narrow road, poorly maintained," to which, though no Kilmerite, I subscribe). From a hired motor-boat operated by an elderly, but stil repulsively handsom e W hite Russian, a baron they said (Lo's palms were dam p, the little fool), who had known in California good old M axim ovich and Valeria, we could distinguish the inaccessible "m il ionaires' colony" on an island, som ewhere off the Georgia coast. W e inspected further: a col ection of European hotel picture post cards in a museum devoted to hobbies at a M ississippi resort, where with a hot wave of pride I discovered a colored photo of my father's M

irana, its striped awnings, its flag flying above the retouched palm trees. "So what?" said Lo, squinting at the bronzed owner of an expensive car who had fol owed us into the Hobby House. Relics of the cotton era. A forest in Arkansas and, on her brown shoulder, a raised purple-pink swel ing (the work of som e gnat) which I eased of its beautiful transparent Page 75

poison between my long thum bnails and then sucked til I was gorged on her spicy blood. Bourbon Street (in a town nam ed New Orleans) whose sidewalks, said the tour book,

"m ay [I liked the "m ay"] feature entertainm ent by pickaninnies who wil {I liked the

"wil " even better] tap-dance for pennies" (what fun), while "its num erous sm al and intimate night clubs are thronged with visitors" (naughty). Col ections of frontier lore. Ante-bel um hom es with iron-trel is balconies and hand-worked stairs, the kind down which m ovie ladies with sun-kissed shoulders run in rich Technicolor, holding up the fronts of their flounced skirts with both little hands in that special way, and the devoted Negress shaking her head on the upper landing. The M enninger Foundation, a psychiatric clinic, just for the heck of it. A patch of beautiful y eroded clay; and yucca blossom s, so pure, so waxy, but lousy with creeping white flies. Independence, M

M ore m ountains; bluish beauties never attainable, or ever turning into inhabited hil after hil ; south-eastern ranges, altitudinal failures as alps go; heart and sky-piercing snow-veined gray colossi of stone, relentless peaks appearing from nowhere at a turn of the highway; timbered enormities, with a system of neatly overlapping dark firs, interrupted in places by pale puffs of aspen; pink and lilac formations, Pharaonic, phal ic, "too prehistoric for words" (blasÃ© Lo); buttes of black lava; early spring m ountains with young-elephant lanugo along their spines; end-of-the-summer m ountains, al hunched up, their heavy Egyptian limbs folded under folds of tawny moth-eaten plush; oatm eal hil s, flecked with green round oaks; a last rufous m ountain with a rich rug of lucerne at its foot. M oreover, we inspected: Little Iceberg Lake, som ewhere in Colorado, and the snow banks, and the cushionets of tiny alpine flowers, and more snow; down which Lo in redpeaked cap tried to slide, and squealed, and was snowbal ed by som e youngsters, and retaliated in kind comme on dit. Skeletons of burned aspens, patches of spired blue flowers. The various item s of a scenic drive. Hundreds of scenic drives, thousands of Bear Creeks, Soda Springs, Painted Canyons. Texas, a drought-struck plain. Crystal Cham ber in the longest cave in the world, children under 12 free, Lo a young captive. A col ection of a local lady's hom em ade sculptures, closed on a miserable M onday morning, dust, wind, witherland. Conception Park, in a town on the M exican border which I dared not cross. There and elsewhere, hundreds of gray hummingbirds in the dusk, probing the throats of dim flowers.

And on M cEwen St., corner of W heaton Ave., in a M ichigan town bearing his first nam e. W e cam e to know the curious roadside species, Hitchhiking M an, Homo pol ex of science, with al its many sub-species and forms; the m odest soldier, spic and span, quietly waiting, quietly conscious of khaki's viatric appeal; the schoolboy wishing to go two blocks; the kil er wishing to go two thousand miles; the mysterious, nervous, elderly gent, with brand-new suitcase and clipped mustache; a trio of optimistic M exicans; the col ege student displaying the grime of vacational outdoor work as proudly as the nam e of the fam ous col ege arching across the front of his sweatshirt; the desperate lady whose battery has just died on her; the clean-cut, glossy-haired, shifty-eyed, white-faced young beasts in loud shirts and coats, vigorously, almost priapical y thrusting out tense thum bs to tem pt lone women or sadsack salesm en with fancy cravings.

"Let's take him," Lo would often plead, rubbing her knees together in a way she had, as som e particularly disgusting pol ex, som e man of my age and shoulder breadth, with the face Ã¡ claques of unem ployed actor, walked backwards, practical y in the path of our car. Oh, I had to keep a very sharp eye on Lo, little limp Lo! Owing perhaps to constant am orous exercise, she radiated, despite her very childish appearance, som e special languorous glow which threw garage fel ows, hotel pages, vacationists, goons in luxurious cars, maroon morons near blued pools, into fits of concupiscence which might have tickled my pride, had it not incensed my jealousy. For little Lo was aware of that glow of hers, and I would often catch her coulant un regard in the direction of som e am iable male, som e grease m onkey, with a sinewy golden-brown forearm and watchbraceleted

wrist, and hardly had I turned my back to go and buy this very Lo a lol ipop, than I would hear her and the fair m echanic burst into a perfect love song of wisecracks. Page 77

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

W hen, during our longer stops, I would relax after a particularly violent morning in bed, and out of the goodness of my lul ed heart al ow her-indulgent Hum!-to visit the rose garden or children's library across the street with a motor court neighbor's plain little M

ary and M ary's eight-year-old brother, Lo would com e back an hour late, with barefoot M

ary trailing far behind, and the little boy metam orphosed into two gangling, goldenhaired high school uglies, al muscles and gonorrhea. The reader may wel imagine what I answered my pet when-rather uncertainly, I adm it-she would ask me if she could go with Carl and Al here to the rol er-skating rink.

I rem em ber the first time, a dusty windy afternoon, I did let her go to one such rink. Cruel y she said it would be no fun if I accom panied her, since that time of day was reserved for teenagers. W e wrangled out a com prom ise: I rem ained in the car, am ong other (em pty) cars with their noses to the canvas-topped open-air rink, where som e fifty young people, many in pairs, were endlessly rol ing round and round to m echanical music, and the wind silvered the trees. Dol y wore blue jeans and white high shoes, as most of the other girls did. I kept counting the revolutions of the rol ing crowd-and suddenly she was missing. W hen she rol ed past again, she was together with three hoodlum s whom I had heard analyze a moment before the girl skaters from the outsideand jeer at a lovely leggy young thing who had arrived clad in red shorts instead of those jeans and slacks.

At inspection stations on highways entering Arizona or California, a policem an's cousin would peer with such intensity at us that my poor heart wobbled. "Any honey?" he would inquire, and every time my sweet fool giggled. I stil have, vibrating al along my optic nerve, visions of Lo on horseback, a link in the chain of a guided trip along a bridle trail: Lo bobbing at a walking pace, with an old woman rider in front and a lecherous rednecked dude-rancher behind; and I behind him, hating his fat flowery-shirted back even more fervently than a motorist does a slow truck on a m ountain road. Or else, at a ski lodge, I would see her floating away from me, celestial and solitary, in an ethereal chairlift, up and up, to a glittering summit where laughing athletes stripped to the waist were waiting for her, for her.

In whatever town we stopped I would inquire, in my polite European way, anent the whereabouts of natatorium s, m useum s, local schools, the num ber of children in the nearest school and so forth; and at school bus time, sm iling and twitching a little (I discovered this tic nerveux because cruel Lo was the first to mimic it), I would park at a strategic point, with my vagrant schoolgirl beside me in the car, to watch the children leave school-always a pretty sight. This sort of thing soon began to bore my so easily bored Lolita, and, having a childish lack of sym pathy for other people's whims, she would insult me and my desire to have her caress me while blue-eyed little brunettes in blue shorts, copperheads in green boleros, and blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks passed by in the sun.

As a sort of com prom ise, I freely advocated whenever and wherever possible the use of swimming pools with other girl-children. She adored bril iant water and was a rem arkably sm art diver. Com fortably robed, I would settle down in the rich post-meridian shade after my own dem ure dip, and there I would sit, with a dummy book or a bag of bonbons, or both, or nothing but my tingling glands, and watch her gam bol, rubbercapped, bepearled, sm oothly tanned, as glad as an ad, in her trim-fitted satin pants and shirred bra. Pubescent sweetheart! How sm ugly would I marvel that she was mine, mine, mine, and revise the recent matitudinal swoon to the moan of the m ourning doves, and devise the late afternoon one, and slitting my sun-speared eyes, com pare Lolita to whatever other nym phets parsim onious chance col ected around her for my anthological delectation and judgm ent; and today, putting my hand on my ailing heart, I real y do not think that any of them ever surpassed her in desirability, or if they did, it was so two or Page 78

three times at the most, in a certain light, with certain perfum es blended in the air-once in the hopeless case of a pale Spanish child, the daughter of a heavy-jawed noblem an, and another time-mais je divague.

Natural y, I had to be always wary, ful y realizing, in my lucid jealousy, the danger of those dazzling rom ps. I had only to turn away for a moment-to walk, say, a few steps in order to see if our cabin was at last ready after the morning change of linen-and Lo and Behold, upon returning, I would find the former, les yeux perdus, dipping and kicking her long-toed feet in the water on the stone edge of which she lol ed, while, on either side of her, there crouched a brun adolescent whom her russet beauty and the quicksilver in the baby folds of her stom ach were sure to cause to se tordre-oh Baudelaire!-in recurrent dream s for m onths to com e.

I tried to teach her to play tennis so we might have more am usem ents in com m on; but although I had been a good player in my prime, I proved to be hopeless as a teacher; and so, in California, I got her to take a num ber of very expensive lessons with a fam ous coach, a husky, wrinkled old-timer, with a harem of bal boys; he looked an awful wreck off the court, but now and then, when, in the course of a lesson, to keep up the exchange, he would put out as it were an exquisite spring blossom of a stroke and twang the bal back to his pupil, that divine delicacy of absolute power made me recal that, thirty years before, I had seen him in Cannes dem olish the great Gobbert! Until she began taking those lessons, I thought she would never learn the gam e. On this or that hotel court I would dril Lo, and try to relive the days when in a hot gale, a daze of dust, and queer lassitude, I fed bal after bal to gay, innocent, elegant Annabel (gleam of bracelet, pleated white skirt, black velvet hair band). W ith every word of persistent advice I would only augm ent Lo's sul en fury. To our gam es, oddly enough, she preferred-at least, before we reached California-formless pat bal approximations-m ore bal hunting than actual play-with a wispy, weak, wonderful y pretty in an ange gauche way coeval. A helpful spectator, I would go up to that other child, and inhale her faint musky fragrance as I touched her forearm and held her knobby wrist, and push this way or that her cool thigh to show her the back-hand stance. In the m eantime, Lo, bending forward, would let her sunny-brown curls hang forward as she stuck her racket, like a cripple's stick, into the ground and em itted a trem endous ugh of disgust at my intrusion. I would leave them to their gam e and look on, com paring their bodies in motion, a silk scarf round my throat; this was in south Arizona, I think-and the days had a lazy lining warmth, and awkward Lo would slash at the bal and miss it, and curse, and send a simulacrum of a serve into the net, and show the wet glistening young down of her armpit as she brandished her racket in despair, and her even more insipid partner would dutiful y rush out after every bal , and retrieve none; but both were enjoying them selves beautiful y, and in clear ringing tones kept the exact score of their ineptitudes al the time. One day, I rem em ber, I offered to bring them cold drinks from the hotel, and went up the gravel path, and cam e back with two tal glasses of pineapple juice, soda and ice; and then a sudden void within my chest made me stop as I saw that the tennis court was deserted. I stooped to set down the glasses on a bench and for som e reason, with a kind of icy vividness, saw Charlotte's face in death, and I glanced around, and noticed Lo in white shorts receding through the speckled shadow of a garden path in the com pany of a tal man who carried two tennis rackets. I sprang after them , but as I was crashing through the shrubbery, I saw, in an alternate vision, as if life's course constantly branched, Lo, in slacks, and her com panion, in shorts, trudging up and down a sm al weedy area, and beating bushes with their rackets in listless search for their last lost bal . I item ize these sunny nothings mainly to prove to my judges that I did everything in my power to give my Lolita a real y good time. How charming it was to see her, a child herself, showing another child som e of her few accom plishm ents, such as for exam ple a Page 79

special way of jum ping rope. W ith her right hand holding her left arm behind her untanned back, the lesser nym phet, a diaphanous darling, would be al eyes, as the pavonine sun was al eyes on the gravel under the flowering trees, while in the midst of that oculate paradise, my freckled and raffish lass skipped, repeating the m ovem ents of so many others I had gloated over on the sun-shot, watered, dam p-sm el ing sidewalks and ram parts of ancient Europe. Presently, she would hand the rope back to her little Spanish friend, and watch in her turn the repeated lesson, and brush away the hair from her brow, and fold her arms, and step on one toe with the other, or drop her hands loosely upon her stil unflared hips, and I would satisfy myself that the dam ned staff had at last finished cleaning up our cottage; whereupon, flashing a sm ile to the shy, dark-haired page girl of my princess and thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into Lo's hair from behind, and then gently but firmly clasping them around the nape of her neck, I would lead my reluctant pet to our sm al hom e for a quick connection before dinner.

"W hose cat has scratched poor you?" A ful -blown fleshy handsom e woman of the repulsive type to which I was particularly attractive might ask me at the "lodge," during a table d'hote dinner fol owed by dancing prom ised to Lo. This was one of the reasons why I tried to keep as far away from people as possible, while Lo, on the other hand, would do her utmost to draw as many potential witnesses into her orbit as she could. She would be, figuratively speaking wagging her tiny tail, her whole behind in fact as little bitches do-while som e grinning stranger accosted us and began a bright conversation with a com parative study of license plates. "Long way from hom e!" Inquisitive parents, in order to pum p Lo about me, would suggest her going to a m ovie with their children. W e had som e close shaves. The waterfal nuisance pursued me of course in al our caravansaries. But I never realized how wafery their wal substance was until one evening, after I had loved too loudly, a neighbor's masculine cough fil ed the pause as clearly as mine would have done; and next morning as I was having breakfast at the milk bar (Lo was a late sleeper, and I liked to bring her a pot of hot coffee in bed), my neighbor of the eve, an elderly fool wearing plain glasses on his long virtuous nose and a convention badge on his lapel, som ehow m anaged to rig up a conversation with me, in the course of which he inquired, if my missus was like his missus a rather reluctant getupper when not on the farm; and had not the hideous danger I was skirting almost suffocated me, I might have enjoyed the odd look of surprise on his thin-lipped weatherbeaten face when I drily answered, as I slithered off my stool, that I was thank God a widower.

How sweet it was to bring that coffee to her, and then deny it until she had done her morning duty. And I was such a thoughtful friend, such a passionate father, such a good pediatrician, attending to al the wants of my little auburn brunette's body! M y only grudge against nature was that I could not turn my Lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix, her unknown heart, her nacreous liver, the sea-grapes of her lungs, her com ely twin kidneys. On especial y tropical afternoons, in the sticky closeness of the siesta, I liked the cool feel of armchair leather against my m assive nakedness as I held her in my lap. There she would be, a typical kid picking her nose while engrossed in the lighter sections of a newspaper, as indifferent to my ecstasy as if it were som ething she had sat upon, a shoe, a dol , the handle of a tennis racket, and was too indolent to rem ove. Her eyes would fol ow the adventures of her favorite strip characters: there was one wel -drawn sloppy bobby-soxer, with high cheekbones and angular gestures, that I was not above enjoying myself; she studied the photographic results of head-on col isions; she never doubted the reality of place, time, and circum stance al eged to match the publicity pictures of naked-thighed beauties; and she was curiously fascinated by the photographs of local brides, som e in ful wedding apparel, holding bouquets and wearing glasses.

A fly would settle and walk in the vicinity of her navel or explore her tender pale areolas. She tried to catch it in her fist (Charlotte's method) and then would turn to the colum n Let's Explore Your M ind.

"Let's explore your mind. W ould sex crimes be reduced if children obeyed a few don'ts?

Don't play around public toilets. Don't take candy or rides from strangers. If picked up, mark down the license of the car."

". . . and the brand of the candy," I volunteered.

She went on, her cheek (recedent) against mine (pursuant); and this was a good day, mark, O reader!

"If you don't have a pencil, but are old enough to read-"

"W e," I quip-quoted, "m edieval mariners, have placed in this bottle-"

"If," she repeated, "you don't have a pencil, but are old enough to read and write-this is what the guy m eans, isn't it, you dope-=scratch the num ber som ehow on the roadside."

"W ith your little claws, Lolita."

She had entered my world, um ber and black Humberland, with rash curiosity; she surveyed it with a shrug of am used distaste; and it seem ed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with som ething akin to plain repulsion. Never did she vibrate under my touch, and a strident "what d'you think you are doing?" was al I got for my pains. To the wonderland I had to offer, my fool preferred the corniest m ovies, the most cloying fudge. To think that between a Ham burger and a Hum burger, she wouldinvariably, with icy precision-plum p for the former. There is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child. Did I mention the nam e of that milk bar I visited a moment ago? It was, of al things, The Frigid Queen. Sm iling a little sadly, I dubbed her M y Frigid Princess. She did not see the wistful joke.

Oh, d not scowl at me, reader, I do not intend to convey the impressin that I did not manage to be happy. Readeer must understand that in the possession and thral dom of a nym phet the enchanted traveler stands, as it were, beyond happiness. For there is no other bliss on earth com parable to that of fondling a nym phet. It is hors concours, that bliss, it belongs to another class, another plane of sensitivity. Despite our tiffs, despite her nastiness, despite al the fuss and faces she made, and the vulgarity, and the danger, and the horrible hopelessness of it al , I stil dwel ed deep in my elected paradise-a paradise whose skies were the color of hel -flam es-but stil a paradise. The able psychiatrist who studies my case-and whom by now Dr. Humbert has plunged, I trust, into a state of leporine fascination-is no doubt anxious to have me take Lolita to the seaside and have me find there, at last, the "gratification" of a lifetime urge, and release from the

"subconscious" obsession of an incom plete childhood rom ance with the initial little M

iss Lee.

W el , com rade, let me tel you that I did look for a beach, though I also have to confess that by the time we reached its mirage of gray water, so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling com panion that the search for a Kingdom by the Sea, a Sublimated Riviera, or whatnot, far from being the im pulse of the subconscious, had becom e the rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thril . The angels knew it, and arranged things accordingly. A visit to a plausible cove on the Atlantic side was com pletely m essed up by foul weather. A thick dam p sky, m uddy waves, a sense of boundless but som ehow matter-of-fact mist-what could be further rem oved from the crisp charm, the sapphire occasion and rosy contingency of my Riviera rom ance? A couple of sem itropical beaches on the Gulf, though bright enough, were starred and couple of sem itropical beaches on the Gulf, though bright enough, were starred and spattered by venom ous beasties and swept by hurricane winds. Final y, on a Californian beach, facing the phantom of the Pacific, I hit upon som e rather perverse privacy in a kind of cave whence you could hear the shrikes of a lot of girl scouts taking their first surf bath on a separate part of the beach, behind rotting trees; but the fog was like a wet blanket, and the Page 81

sand was gritty and clammy, and Lo was al gooseflesh and grit, and for the first time in my life I had as little desire for her as for a manatee. Perhaps, my learned readers may perk up if I tel them that even had we discovered a piece of sym pathetic seaside som ewhere, it would have com e too late, since my real liberation had occurred much earlier: at the moment, in point of fact, when Annabel Haze, alias Dolores Lee, alias Loleeta, had appeared tom e, golden and brown, kneeling, looking up, on that shoddy veranda, in a kind of fictitious, dishonest, but em inently satisfactory seaside arrangem ent (although there was nothing but a second-rate lake in the neighborhood.). So much for those special sensations, influence, if not actual y brought about, by the tenets of m odern psychiatry. Consequently, I turned away-I headed my Lolita away-from beaches which were either too bleak when lone, or too populous when ablaze. However, in recol ection, I suppose, of my hopeless hauntings of public parks in Europe, I was stil keenly interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable playgrounds in the open where I had suffered such sham eful privations. Here, too, I was to be thwarted. The disappointment I must now register (as I gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread that ran through my bliss) should in no wise reflect on the lyrical, epic, tragic buit never Arcadian American wilds. They are beautiful, heart-rendingly beautiful, those wilds, with a quality of wide-eyed, unsung, innocent surrender that my lacquered, toybright Swiss vil ages and exhaustively lauded Alps no longer possess. Innum erable lovers have clipped and kissed on the trim turf of old-would m ountainsides, on the innerspring m oss, by a handy, hygienic ril , on rustic benches under the initialed oaks, and in so many cabanes in so many beech forests. But in the W ilds of America the open-air lover wil not find it easy to indulge in the most ancient of al crimes and pastimes. Poisonous plants burn his sweetheart's buttocks, nam eless insects sting his; sharp item s of the forest floor prick his knees, insects hers; and al around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes-que dis-je, of sem i-extinct dragons!-while the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling, in a hideous green crust, to gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike.

I am exaggerating a little. One summer noon, just below timberline, where heavenly-hued blossom s that I would fain cal larkspur crowded al along a purly m outain brook, we did find, Lolita and I, a secluded rom antic spot, a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car. The slope seem ed untrodden. A last panting pine was taking a wel earned breather on the rock it had reached. A marmot whistled at us and withdrew. Beneath the lap-robe I had spread fo Lor, dryflowers crepitated softly. Venus cam e and went. The jagged cliff crowning the upper talus and a tangle of shrugs growing below us seem ed to offer us protection from sun and man alike. Alas, I had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in cagey fashion am ong the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us.

It was then that we cam e close to detection than ever before, and no wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural am ours.

I rem em ber the operation was over, al over, and she was weeping in my arms;-a salutory storm of sobs after one of the fits of m oodiness that had becom e so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise adm irable year! I had just retracted som e sil y prom ise she had forced me to make in a moment of blind impatient passion, and thee she was sprawling and sobbing, and pinching my caressing hand, and I was laughing happily, and the atrocious, unbelievable, unbearable, and, I suspect, eternal horror that I know now was stil but a dot of blackness in the blue of my bliss; and so we lay, when with one of those jolts that have ended by knocking my poor heart out of its groove, I met the unblinking dark eyes of two strange and beautiful children, faunlet and nym phet, whom their identical flat dark hair and bloodless cheeks proclaimed siblings if not twins. They stood crouching and gaping at us, both in blue playsuits, blending with the m ountain Page 82

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

blossom s. I plucked at the lap-robe for desperate concealment-and within the sam e instant, som ething that looked like a polka-dotted pushbal am ong the undergrowth a few paces away, went into a turning motion which was transformed into the gradual y rising figure of a stout lady with a raven-black bob, who autom atical y added a wild lily to her bouquet, while staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovely carved bluestone children.

Now that I have an altogether different m ess on my conscience, I know that I am a courageous man, but in those days I was not aware of it, and I rem em ber being surprised by my own coolness. W ith the quiet murmured order one gives a sweatstained distracted cringing trained animal even in the worst of plights (what mad hope or hate makes the young beast's flanks pulsate, what black stars pierce the heart of the tam er!), I made Lo get up, and we decorously walked, and then indecorously scuttled down to the car. Behind it a nifty station wagon was parked, and a handsom e Assyrian with q little blueblack beard, un m onsieur trÃ©s bien, in silk shirt and magenta slacks, presum ably the corpulent botanist's husband, was gravely taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass. It was wel over 10,000 feet and I was quite out of breath; and with a scrunch and a skid we drove off, Lo stil struggling with her clothes and swearing at me in language that I never dream ed little girls could know, let alone use. There were other unpleasant incidents. There was the m ovie theatre once, for exam ple. Lo at the time stil had for the cinem a a veritable passion (it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high school year). W e took in, voluptuously and indiscriminately, oh, I don't know, one hundred and fifty or two hundred program s during that one year, and during som e of the denser periods of m ovie-going we saw many of the newsreels up to half-a-dozen times since the sam e weekly one went with different main pictures and pursued us from town to town. Her favorite kinds were, in this order: musicals, underworlders, westerners. In the first, real singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essential y grief-proof sphere of existence wherefrom death and truth were banned, and where, at the end, white-haired, dewy-eyed, technical y deathless, the initial y reluctant father of a show-crazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on fabulous Broadway. The underworld was a world apart: there, heroic newspapermen were tortured, telephone bil s ran to bil ions, and, in a robust atm osphere of incom petent marksm anship, vil ains were chased through sewers and store-houses by pathological y fearless cops (I was to give them less exercise). Final y there was the m ahogany landscape, the florid-faced, blue-eyed roughriders, the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in Roaring Gulch, the rearing horse, the spectacular stam pede, the pistol thrust through the shivered windowpane, the stupendous fist fight, the crashing m ountain of dusty oldfashioned furniture, the table used as a weapon, the timely som ersault, the pinned hand stil groping for the dropped bowie knife, the grunt, the sweet crash of fist against chin, the kick in the bel y, the flying tackle; and immediately after a plethora of pain that would have hospitalized a Hercules (I should know by now), nothing to show but the rather becom ing bruise on the bronzed cheek of the warmed-up hero em bracing his gorgeous frontier bride. I rem em ber one matinee in a sm al airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of popcorn. The m oon was yel ow above the neckerchiefed crooner, and his finger was on his strum string, and his foot was on a pine log, and I had innocently encircled Lo's shoulder and approached my jawbone to her tem ple, when two harpies behind us started muttering the queerest things-I do not know if I understood aright, but what I thought I did, made me withdraw my gentle hand, and of course the rest of the show was fog to me. Another jolt I rem em ber is connected with a little burg we were traversing at night, during our return journey. Som e twenty miles earlier I had happened to tel her that the day school she would attend at Beardsley was a rather high-class, non-coeducational one, Page 83

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

with no m odern nonsense, whereupon Lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where entreaty and insult, self-assertion and double talk, vicious vulgarity and childish despair, were interwoven in an exasperating sem blance of logic which prom pted a sem blance of explanation from me. Enm eshed in her wild words (swel chance . .

. I'd be a sap if I took your opinion seriously . . . Stinker . . . You can't boss me . . . I despise you . . . and so forth), I drove throuth the slum bering town at a fifty-mile-per-hour pace in continuance of my sm ooth highway swoosh, and a twosome of patrolmen put their spotlight on the car, and told me to pul over. I shushed Lo who was autom atical y raving on. The men peered at her and me with malevolent curiosity. Suddenly al dimples, she beam ed sweetly at them , as she never did at my orchideous masculinity; for, in a sense, my Lo was even more scared of the law than I-and when the kind officers pardoned us and servilely we crawled on, her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked limp prostration.

At this point I have a curious confession to make. You wil laugh-but real y and truly I som ehow never m anaged to find out quite exactly what the legal situation was. I do not know it yet. Oh, I have learned a few odds and ends. Alabam a prohibits a guardian from changing the ward's residence without an order of the court; M innesota, to whom I take off my hat, provides that when a relative assum es perm anent care and custody of any child under fourteen, the authority of a court does not com e into play. Query: is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet, a stepfather of only one m onth's standing, a neurotic widower of mature years and sm al but independent m eans, with the parapets of Europe, a divorce and a few m adhouses behind him, is he to be considered a relative, and thus a natural guardian? And if not, must I, and could I reasonably dare notify som e W elfare Board and file a petition (how do you file a petition?), and have a court's agent investigate m eek, fishy me and dangerous Dolores Haze? The many books on marriage, rape, adoption and so on, that I guiltily consulted at the public libraries of big and sm al towns, told me nothing beyond darkly insinuating that the state is the superguardian

of minor children. Pilvin and Zapel, if I rem em ber their nam es right, in an impressive volum e on the legal side of marriage, com pletely ignored stepfathers with motherless girls on their hands and knees. M y best friend, a social service m onograph(Chicago, 1936), which was dug out for me at great pains form a dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster, said "There is no principle that every minor must have a guardian; the court is passive and enters the fray only when the child's situation becom es conspicuously perilous." A guardian, I concluded, was appointed only when he expressed his solem n and formal desire; but m onths might elapse before he was given notice to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings, and in the m eantime the fair dem on child was legal y left to her own devices which, after al , was the case of Dolores Haze. Then cam e the hearing. A few questions from the bench, a few reassuring answers from the attorney, a sm ile, a nod, a light drizzle outside, and the appointment was made. And stil I dared not. Keep away, be a m ouse, curl up in yourhole. Courts becam e extravagantly active only when there was som e m onetary question involved: two greedy guardians, a robbed orphan, a third, stil greedier, party. But here al was in perfect order, and inventory had been made, and her mother's sm al property was waiting untouched for Dolores Haze to grow up. The best policy seem ed to be to refrain from any application. Or would som e busybody, som e Humane Society, butt in if I kept too quiet?

Friend Farlow, who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to give me som e solid advice, was too much occupied with Jean's cancer to do anything more than what he had prom ised-nam ely, to look after Chrlotte's m eager estate while I recovered very gradual y from the shock of her death. I had conditioned him into believing Dolores was my natural child, and so could not expect him to bother his head about the situation. I am

as the reader must have gathered by now, a poor businessm an; but neither ignorance nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice elsewhere. W hat stopped me ws the awful feeling that if I m eddled with fate in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift, that gift would be snatched away like that palace on the m ountain top in the Oriental tale which vanished whenever a prospective owner asked its custodian how com e a strip of sunset sky was clearly visible from afar between black rock and foundation.

I decided that at Beardsley (the site of Bearsley Col ege for W omen) I would have access to works of reference that I had not yet been able to study, such as W oerner's Treatise

"On the American Law of Guardianship" and certain United States Children's Bureau Publications. I also decided that anything was better for Lo than the dem oralizing idleness in which she lived. I could persuade her to do so many things-their list mnight stupefy a professional educator; but no matter how I pleaded or stormed, I could never make her read any other book than the so-cl ed com ic books or stories in magazines for American fem ales. Any literature a peg higher sm acked to her of school, and though theoretical y wil ing to enjoy A Girl of the Limberlost or the Arabian Nights, or Little W

omen, she was quite sure she would not fritter away her "vacation" on such highbrow reading matter.

I now think it was a great mistake to m ove east again and have her go to that private school in Beardsley, instead of som ehow scram bling across the M exican border while the scram bling was good so as to lie low for a couple of years in subtropical bliss until I could safely marry my little Creole; for I must confess that depending on the conditin of my glands and ganglia, I could switch in the course of the sam e day from one pole of insanity to the other-from the thought that around 1950 I would have to get rid som ehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nym phage had evaporated-to the thought that with patience and luckI might have her produce eventual y a nym phet with my blood in her exquisite veins, a Lolita the Second, who would be eight or nine around 1960, when I would stil be dans la force de l'Ã¢ge; indeed, the telescopy of my mind, or un-mind, was strong enough to distinguish in the rem oteness of time a vieil ard encore vert-or was it green rot?-bizarre, tender, salivating Dr. Humbert, practicing on suprem ely lovely Lolita the Third the art of being a granddad. In the days of that wild journey of ours, I doubted not that as father to Lolita the First I was a ridiculous failure. I did my best; I read and reread a book with the unintentional y biblical title Know Your Own Daughter, which I got at the sam e store where I bought Lo, for her thirteenth birthday, a de luxe volum e with commercial y "beautiful" il ustrations, of Andersen's The Little M ermaid. But even at our very best moments, when we sat reading on a rainy day (Lo's glance skipping from the window to her wrist watch and back again), or had a quiet hearty m eal in a crowded diner, or played a childish gam e of cards, or went shopping, or silently stared, with other motorists and their children, at som e sm ashed, blood-bespattered car with a young woman's shoe in the ditch (Lo, as we drove on: "that was the exact type of m occasin I was trying to describe to that jerk in the store"); on al those random occasions, I seem ed to myself as implausible a father as she seem ed to be a daughter. W as, perhaps, guilty locom otion instrum ental in vitiating our powers of impersonation? W ould improvem ent be forthcom ing with a fixed dom icile and a routine schoolgirl's day?

In my choice of Beardsley I was guided not only by the fact of there being a com paratively sedate school for girls located there, but also by the presence of the women's col ege. In my desire to get myself casÃ©, to attach myself som ehow to som e patterned surface which my stripes would blend with, I thought of a man I knew in the department of French at Beardsley Col ege; he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had attem pted to get me over once to deliver a lecture. I had no intention Page 85

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

of doing so, since, as I have once rem arked in the course of these confessions, there are few physiques I loathe more than the heavy low-slung pelvis, thick calves and deplorable com plexion of the average coed (in whom I see, maybe, the coffin of coarse fem ale flesh within which my nym phets are buried alive); but I did crave for a label, a background, and a simulacrum , and, as presently wil becom e clear, there was a reason, a rather zany reason, why old Gaston Godin's com pany would be particularly safe. Final y, there was the m oney question. M y incom e was cracking under the strain of our joy-ride. True, I clung to the cheaper motor courts; but every now and then, there would be a loud hotel de luxe, or a pretentious dude ranch, to mutilate our budget; staggering sum s, moreover, were expended on sightseeing and Lo's clothes, and the old Haze bus, although a stil vigorous and very devoted m achine, necessitated num erous minor and major repairs. In one of our strip maps that has happened to survive am ong the papers which the authorities have so kindly al owed me to use for the purpose of writing my statem ent, I find som e jottings that help me com pute the fol owing. During that extravagant year 1947-1948, August to August, lodgings and food cost us arround 5,500

dol ars; gas, oil and repairs, 1,234, and various extras almost as much; so that during about 150 days of actual motion (we covered about 27,000 miles!) plus som e 200 days of interpolated standstil s, this m odest rentier spent around 8,000 dol ars, or better say 10,000 because, unpractical as I am , I have surely forgotten a num ber of item s. And so we rol ed East, I more devastated than braced with the satisfaction of my passion, and she glowing with health, her bi-iliac garland stil as brief as a lad's, although she had added two inches to her stature and eight pounds to her weight. W e had been everywhere. W e had real y seen nothing. And I catch myself thinking that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dream y, enorm ous country that by then, in retrospect, was no more to us than a col ection of dog-eared maps, ruined tour books, old tires, and her sobs in the night-every night, every night-the moment I feigned sleep.

W hen, through decorations of light and shade, we drove to 14 Thayer Street, a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from Gaston who had rented the house for us. M

y Lo, without granting her new surroundings one glance, unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the sam e precise and blind m anner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether anatom y of a lam p table.

I real y did not mind where to dwel provided I could lock my Lolita up som ewhere; but I had, I suppose, in the course of my correspondence with vague Gaston, vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick. Actual y the place bore a dejected resem blance to the Haze hom e (a mere 400 distant): it was the sam e sort of dul gray fram e affair with a shingled roof and dul green dril awnings; and the room s, though sm al er and furnished in a more consistent plush-and-plate style, were arranged in much the sam e order. M y study turned out to be, however, a much larger room , lined from floor to ceiling with som e two thousand books on chem istry which my landlord (on sabbatical leave for the time being) taught at Beardsley Col ege.

I had hoped Beardsley School for girls, an expensive day school, with lunch thrown in and a glam orous gym nasium , would, while cultivating al those young bodies, provide som e formal education for their minds as wel . Gaston Godin, who was seldom right in his judgm ent of American habitus, had warned me that the institution might turn out to be one of those where girls are taught, as he put it with a foreigner's love for such things:

"not to spel very wel , but to sm el very wel ." I don't think they achieved even that. At my first interview with headm istress Pratt, she approved of my child's "nice blue eyes" (blue! Lolita!) and of my own friendship with that "French genius" (a genius! Gaston!) Page 86

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

and then, having turned Dol y over to a M iss Cormorant, she wrinkled her brow in a kind of recueil em ent and said:

"W e are not so much concerned, M r. Humbird, with having our students becom e bookworms or be able to reel off al the capitals of Europe which nobody knows anyway, or learn by heart the dates of forgotten battles. W hat we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life. This is why we stress the four D's: Dram atics, Dance, Debating and Dating. W e are confronted by certain facts. Your delightful Dol y wil presently enter an age groupwhere dates, dating, date dress, date book, date etiquette, m ean as much to her as, say, business, business connections, business success, m ean to you, or as much as [sm iling] the happiness of my girls m eans to me. Dorothy Humbird is already involved in a whole system of social life which consists, whether we like ti or not, of hot-dog stands, corner drugstores, malts and cokes, m ovies, square-dancing, blanket parties on beaches, and even hair-fixing parties! Natural y at Beardsley School we disapprove of som e of these activities; and we rechannel others into more constructive directions. But we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the sunshine. To put it briefly, while adopting certain teaching techniques, we are more interested in com m unication than in com position. That is, with due respect to Shakespeare and others, we want our girls to com m unicate freely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old books. W e are stil groping perhaps, but we grope intel igently, like a gynecologist feeling a tum or. W e thing, Dr. Hum burg, in organissm al and organizational terms. W e have done away with the m ass or irrelevant topics that have traditional y been presented to young girls, leaving no place, in former days, for the knowledges and the skil s, and the attitudes they wil need in managing their lives and-as the cynic might add-the lives of their husbands. M r. Humberson, let us put it this way: the position of a star is im portant, but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be even more im portant to the budding housewife. You say that al you expect a child to obtain from school is a sound education. But what do we m ean by education? In the old days it was in the main a verbal phenom enon; I m ean, you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopedia and he or she would know as much as or more than a school could offer. Dr. Hummer, do you realize that for the m odern preadolescent child, medieval dates are of less vital value than weekend ones [twinkle]?to repeat a pun that I heard the Beardsley col ege psychoanalyst permit herself the other day. W e live not only in a world of thughts, but also in a world of things. W rds without experience are m eaningless. W hat on earth can Dorothy Hummerson care for Greece and the Orient with their harem s and slaves?"

This program rather appal ed me, but I spoke to two intel igent ladies who had been connected with the school, and they affirmed that the girls did quite a bit of sound reading and that the "com m unication" line was more or less bal yhoo aimed at giving oldfashioned

Beardsley School a financial y rem unerative m odern touch, though actual y it rem ained as prim as a prawn.

Another reason attracting me to that particular school may sweem funny to som e readers, but it was very im portant to me, for that is the way I am made. Across our street, exactly in front of our house, there was, I noticed, a gap of weedy wasteland, with som e colorful bushes and a pile of bricks and a few scattered planks, and the foam of shabby m auve and chrom e autum n roadside flowers; and through that gap you could see a shimmery section of School Rd., running paral el to our Thayer St., and immediately beyond that, the playground of the school Apart from the psychological com fort this general arrangem ent should afford me by keeping Dol y's day adjacent to mine, I immediately foresaw the pleasure I would have in distinguishing from my study-bedroom

, by m eans of powerful binoculars, the statistical y inevitable percentage of nym phets am ong the other girl Page 87

children playing around Dol y during recess; unfortunately, on the very first day of school, workm en arrived and put up a fence som e way down the gap, and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond that fence utterly blocking my magic vista; and as soon as they had erected a sufficient am ount of material to spoil everything, those absurd builders suspended their work and never appeared again. 5

In a street cal ed Thayer Street, in the residential green, fawn, and golden of a mel ow academ ic townlet, one was bound to have a few am iable fine-dayers yelping at you. I prided myself on the exact tem perature of my relations with them : never rude, always aloof. M y west-door neighbor, who might have been a businessm an or a col ege teacher, or both, would speak to me once in a while as he barbered som e late garden bloom s or watered his car, or, at a later date, defrosted his driveway (I don't mind if these verbs are al wrong), but my brief grunts, just suffice\iently articulate to sound like conventional assents or interrogative pause-fil ers, precluded any evolution toward chumminess. Of the two houses flanking the bit of scrubby waste opposite, one was closed, and the other contained two professors of English, tweedy and short-haired M

iss Lester and fadedly fem inine M iss Fabian, whose only subject of brief sidewalk conversation with me was (God bless their tact!) the young loveliness of my daughter and the naÃ¯ve charm of Gaston Godin. M y east-door neighbor was by far the most dangerous one, a sharp-nosed stock character whose late brother had been attached to the Col ege as Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. I rem em ber her waylaying Dol y, while I stood at the living room window, feverishly awaiting my darling's return from school. The odious spinster, trying to conceal her morbid inquisitiveness under a mask of dulcet goodwil , stood leaning on her slim um brel a (the sleet had just stopped, a cold wet sun had sidled out), and Dol y, her brown coat open despite the raw weather, her structural heap of books pressed against her stom ach, her knees showing pink above her clum sy wel ingtons, a sheepish frightened slittle sm ile flitting over and off her snubnosed face, which-owing perhaps to the pale wintry light-looked almost plain, in a rustic, German, mÃ¤gdlein-like way, as she stood there and dealt with M iss East's questions

"And where is your mother, my dear? And what is your poor father's occupation? And where did you love before?" Another time the loathsom e creature accosted me with a welcom ing whine-but I evaded her; and a few days later there cam e from her a note in a blue-margined envelope, a nice mixture of poison and treacle, suggesting Dol y com e over on a Sunday and curl up in a chair to look through the "loads of beautiful books my dear mother gave me when I was a child, instead of having the radio on at ful blast til al hours of the night." I had also to be careful in regard to a M rs. Holigan, a charwoman and cook of sorts whom I had inherited with the vacuum cleaner from the previous tenants. Dol y got lunch at school, so that this was no trouble, and I had becom e adept at providing her with a big breakfast and warming up the dinner that M rs. Holigan prepared before leaving. That kindly and harmless woman had, thank God, a rather bleary eye that missed details, and I had becom e a great expert in bedm aking; but stil I was continuously obsessed by the feeling that som e fatal stain had been left som ewhere, or that, on the rare occasions where Holigan's presence happened to coincide with Lo's, simple Lo might succum b to buxom sym pathy in the course of a cozy kitchen chat. I often felt we lived in a lighted house of glass, and any moment som e thin-lipped parchm ent face would peer through a carelessly unshaded window to obtain a free glimpse of things that the most jaded voyeur would have paid a sm al fortune to watch. 6

A word about Gaston Godin. The main reason why I enjoyed-or at least tolerated with relief-his com pany was the spel of absolute security that his am ple person cast on my secret. Not that he knew it; I had no special reason to confide in him, and he was much Page 88

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

too self-centered and abstract to notice or suspect anything that might lead to a frank question on his part and a frank answer on mine. He spoke wel of me to Beardsleyans, he was my good herald. Had he discovered mes goÃ»ts and Lolita's status, it would have interested him only insofar as throwing som e light on the simplicity of my attitude towards him, which attitude was as free of polite strain as it was of ribald al usions; for despite his colorless mind and dim memory, he was perhaps aware that I knew more about him than the burghers of Beardsley did. He was a flabby, dough-faced, melancholy bachelor tapering upward to a pair of narrow, not quite level shoulders and a conical pear-head which had sleek black hair on one side and only a few plastered wisps on the other. But the lower part of his body was enorm ous, and he am bulated with a curious elephantine stealth by m eans of phenom ental y stout legs. He always woer black, even his tie was black; he seldom bathed; his English was a burlesque. And, nonetheless, everybody considered him to be a suprem ely lovable, lovably freakish fel ow! Neighbors pam pered him; he knew by nam e al the sm al boys in our vicinity (he lived a few blocks away from me)and had som e of them clean his sidewalk and burn leaves in his back yard, and bring wood from his shed, and even perform simple chores about the house, and he would feed them fancy chocolates, with real liqueurs inside-in the privacy of an oriental y furnished den in his basem ent, with am using daggers and pistols arrayed on the moldy, rug-adorned wal s am ong the cam ouflaged hot-water pipes. Upstairs he had a studio-he painted a little, the old fraud. He had decorated its sloping wal (it was real y not more than a garret) with large photographs of pensive AndrÃ© Gide, TchaÃ¯kovsky, Norman Douglas, two other wel -known English writers, Nijinsky (al thighs and fig leaves), Harold D. Doublenam e (a misty-eyed left-wing professor at a M idwesten university) and M arcel Proust. Al these poor people seem ed about to fal on you from their inclined plane. He had also an album with snapshots of al the Jackies and Dickies of the neighborhood, and when I happened to thum b through it and make som e casual rem ark, Gaston would purse his fat lips and murmur with a wistful pout "Oui, ils sont gentils." His brown eyes would roam around the various sentimental and artistic bricabrac present, and his own banal toiles (the conventional y primitive eyes, sliced guitars, blue nipples and geom etrical designs of the day), and with a vague gesture toward a painted wooden bowl or veined vase, he would say "Prenez donc une de ces poires. La bonne dam e d'en face m'en offre plus que je n'en peux savourer." Or: "M ississe Tail e Lore vient de me donner ces dahlias, bel es fleurs que j'exÃ¨cre." (Som ber, sad, ful of world-weariness.)

For obvious reasons, I preferred m yhouse to his for the gam es of chess we had two or three times weekly. He looked like som e old battered idol as he sat with his pudgy hands in his lap and stared at the board as if it were a corpse. W heezing he would mediate for ten minutes-then make a losing m ove. Or the good man, after even more thought, might utter: Au roi! W ith a slow old-dog woof that had a gargling sound at the back of it which made his jowls wabble; and then he would lift his circum flex eyebrows with a deep sigh as I pointed out to him that he was in check himself. Som etimes, from where we sat in my cold study I could hear Lo's bare feet practicing dance techniques in the living room downstairs; but Gaston's outgoing senses were com fortably dul ed, and he rem ained unaware of those naked rhythm s-and-one, andtwo, and-one, and-two, weight transferred on a straight right leg, leg up and out to the side, and-one, and-two, and only when she started jum ping, opening her legs at the height of the jum p, and flexing one leg, and extending the other, and flying, and landing on her toes-only then did my pale, pom pous, morose opponent rub his head or cheek a if confusing those distant thuds with the awful stabs of my formidable Queen. Som etimes Lola would slouch in while we pondered the board-and it was every time a treat to see Gaston, his elephant eye stil fixed on his pieces, cerem oniously rise to shake Page 89

hands with her, and forthwith release her limp fingers, and without looking once at her, descend again into his chair to topple into the trap I had laid for him. One day around Christmas, after I had not seen him for a fortnight or so, he asked me "Et toutes vos fil ettes, el es vont bien?" from which it becam e evident to me that he had multiplied my unique Lolita by the num ber of sartorial categories his downcast m oody eye had glimpsed during a whole series of her appearances: blue jeans, a skirt, shorts, a quilted robe.

I am loath to dwel so long on the poor fel ow (sadly enough, a year later, during a voyage to Europe, from which he did not return, he got involved in a sale histoire, in Napes of al places!). I would have hardly al uded to him at al had not his Beardsley existence had such a queer bearing on my case. I need him for my defense. There he was devoid of any talent whatsoever, a mediocre teacher, a worthless scholar, a glum repulsive fat old invert, highly contem ptuous of the American way of life, trium phantly ignorant of the English language-there he was in priggish New England, crooned over by the old and caressed by the young-oh, having a grand time and fooling everybody; and here was I. 7

I am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop in Lolita's morals. If her share in the ardors she kindled had never am ounted to much, neither had pure lucre ever com e to the fore. But I was weak, I was not wise, my school-girl nym phet had me in thral . W ith the hum an elem ent dwindling, the passion, the tenderness, and the torture only increased; and of this she took advantage.

Her weekly al owance, paid to her under condition she fulfil her basic obligations, was twenty-one cents at the start of the Beardsley era-and went up to one dol ar five before its end. This was a more than generous arrangem ent seeing she constantly received from me al kinds of sm al presents and had for the asking any sweetm eat or m ovie under the m oon-although, of course, I might fondly dem and an additional kiss, or even a whole col ection of assorted caresses, when I knew she coveted very badly som e item of juvenile am usem ent. She was, however, not easy to deal with. Only very listlessly did she earn her three pennies-or three nickels-per day; and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to deny me certain life-wrecking, strange, slow paradisal philters without which I could not live more than a few days in a row, and which, because of the very nature of love's languor, I could not obtain by force. Knowing the magic and might of her own soft m outh, she m anaged-during one schoolyear!-to raise the bonus price of a fancy em brace to three, and even four bucks! O Reader! Laugh not, as you imagine me, on the very rack of joy noisily em itting dimes and quarters, and great big silver dol ars like som e sonorous, jingly and whol y dem ented m achine vom iting riches; and in the margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins in her little fist, which, anyway, I used to pry open afterwards unless she gave me the slip, scram bling away to hide her loot. And just as every other day I would cruise al around the school area and on com atose feet visit drugstores, and peer into foggy lanes, and listen to receding girl laughter in between my heart throbs and the fal ing leaves, so every now and then I would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in the wastebasket with the painted roses, and look under the pil ow of the virginal bed I had just made myself. Once I found eight one-dol ar notes in one of her books (fittinglyTreasure Island), and once a hole in the wal behind W histler's M other yielded as much as twenty-four dol ars and som e change-say twenty-four sixty-which I quietly rem oved, upon which, next day, she accused, to my face, honest M rs. Holigan of being a filthy thief. Eventual y, she lived up to her I.Q. by finding a safer hoarding place which I never discovered; but by that time I had brought prices down drastical y by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the school's theatrical program ; because what I feared Page 90

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

most was not that she might ruin me, but that she might accum ulate sufficient cash to run away. I believe the poor fierce-eyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dol ars in her urse she might som ehow reach Broadway or Hol ywood-or the foul kitchen of a diner (Help W anted) in a dism al ex-prairie state, with the wind blowing, and the stars blinking, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen, and everything soiled, torn, dead. 8

I did my best, your Honr, to tackele the problem of boys. Oh, I used even to read in the Beardsley Star a so-cal ed Colum n for Teens, to find out how to behave!

A word to fathers. Don't frighten away daughter's friend. M aybe it is a bit hard for you to realize that now the boys are finding her attractive. To you she is stil a little girl. To the boys she's charming and fun, lovely and gay. They like her. Today you clinch big deals in an exectuvie's office, but yesterday you were just highschool Jim carrying Jane's school books. Remember? Don't you want your daughter, now that her turn has com e, to be happy in the adm iration and com pany of boys she likes? Don't you want your daughter, now that her turn has com e, to be happy in the adm iration and com pany of boys she likes? Don't you want them to have wholesom e fun together?

W holesom e fun? Good Lord!

W hy not treat the young fel ows as guests in your house? W hy not make conversation with them ? Draw them out, make them laugh and feel at ease?

W elcom e, fel ow, to this brdel o.

If she breaks the rules don't explode out loud in front of her partner in crime. Let her take the brunt of your displeasure in private. And stop making the boys feel she's the daughter of an old ogre.

First of al the old ogre drew up a list under "absolutely forbidden" and another under

"reluctantly al owed." Absolutely forbidden were dates, single or double or triple-the next step being of course m ass orgy. She might visit a candy bar with her girl friends, and there giggle-chat with occasional young males, while I waited in the car at a discreet distance; and I prom ised her that if her group were invited by a social y acceptable group in Butler's Academ y for Bo[ys for their annual bal (heavily chaperoned, of course), I might consider the question whether a girl of fourteen can don her first "formal" (a kind of gown that makes thin-armed teen-agers look like flam ingoes). M oreover, I prom ised her to throw a party a t our house to which she would be al owed to invite her prettier girl friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the Butler dance. But I was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would never, never be permitted to go with a youngster in rut to a m ovie, or neck in a car, or go to boy-girl parties at the housesof schoolmates, or indulge out of my earshot in boy-girl telephone conversations, even if "only discussing his relations with a friend of mine." Lo was enraged by al thiscal ed me a lousy crook and worse-and I would probably have lost my tem per had I not soon discovered, to my sweetest relief, that what real y angered her was my depriving her not of a specific satisfaction but of a general right. I was impinging, you see, on the conventional program , the stock pastimes, the "things that are done," the routie of youth; for there is nothing more conservative than a child, especial y a girl-child, be she the most auburn and russet, the most mythopoeic nym phet in October's orchard-haze. Do not misunderstand me. I cannot be absolutely certain that in the course of the winter she did not manage to have, in a casual way, improper contacts with unknown young fel ows; of course, no matter how closely I control ed her leisure, there would constantly occur unaccounted-for time leaks with over-elaborate explanations to stop them up in retrospect; of course, my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine fabrics of nym phet falsity; but I did definitely feel-and can now vouchsafe for the accuracy of my feeling-that there was no reason for serious alarm. I felt that way not Page 91

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

because I never once discovered any palpable hard young throat to crush am ong the masculine mutes that flickered som ewhere in the background; but because it was to me

"overwhelmingly obvious" (a favorite expression with my aunt Sybil) that al varieties of high school boys-from the perspiring nincom poop whom "holding hands" thril s, to the self-sufficient rapist with pustules and a souped-up car-equal y bored my sophisticated young mistress. "Al this noise about boys gags me," she had scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook, and underneath, in M ona's hand (M ona is due any minute now), there was the sly quip: "W hat about Rigger?" (due too).

Faceless, then, are the chappies I happened to see in her com pany. There was for instance Red Sweater who one day, the day we had the first snow-saw her hom e; from the parlor window I observed them talking near our porch. She wre her first cloth coat with a fur col ar; there was a sm al brown cap on my favorite hairdo-the fringe in front and the swirl at the sides and the natural curls at the back-and her dam p-dark m occasins and white socks were more sloppy than ever. She pressed as usual her books to her chest while speaking or listening, and her feet gestured al the time: she would stand on her left instep with her right toe, rem ove it backward, cross her feet, rock slightly, sketch a few steps, and then start the series al over again. There was W indbreaker who talked to her in front of a restaurant one Sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attem pted to walk me away for a chat; I dragged along and looked back at my only love. She had developed more than one conventional m annerism , such as the polite adolescent way of showing one is literal y "doubled up" with laughter by incling one's head, and so (as she sensed my cal ), stil feigning helpless merriment, she walked backward a couple of steps, and then faced about, and walked toward me with a fading sm ile. On the other hand, I greatly liked-perhaps because it rem inded me of her first unforgettable confession-her trick of sighing "oh dear!" in hum orous wistufl subm ission to fate, or em itting a long "no-o" in a deep almost growling undertone when thye blow of fate had actual y fal en. Above al -since we are speaking of m ovem ent and youth-I liked to see her spinning up and down Thayer Street on her beautiful young bicycle: rising on the pedals to work on them lustily, then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off; and then she would stop at our mailbox and, stil astride, would flip through a magazine she found there, and put it back, and press her tongue to one side of her upper lip and push off with her foot, and again sprint through pale shade and sun. On the whole she seem ed to me better adapted to her surroundings than I had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slave-child and the bangles of dem eanor she naÃ¯vely affected the winter before in california. Although I could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which the guilty, the great, the tenderhearted live, I felt I was doing my best in the way of mimicry. As I lay on my narrow studio bed a fter asession of adoration and despair in Lolita's cold bedroom , I used to review the concluded day by checking my own image as it prowled rather than passed before the mind's red eye. I watched dark-and-handsom e, not un-Celtic, probably high-church, possibly very highchurch, Dr. Humbert see his daughter off to school I watched him greet with his slow sm ile and pleasantly arched thick black ad-eyebrows good M rs. Holigan, who sm el ed of the plague (and would head, I knew, for master's gin at the first opportunity). W ith M r. W est, retired executioner or writer of religious tracts-who cared?I saw neighbor what's his nam e, I think they are French or Swiss, meditate in his frankwindowed study over a typewriter, rather gaunt-profiled, an almost Hitlerian cowlick on his pale brow. W eekends, wearing a wel -tailored overcoat and brown gloves, Professor H. might be seen with his daughter strol ing to W alton Inn (fam ous for its violet-ribboned china bunnies and chocolate boxes am ong which you sit and wait for a "table for two" stil filthy with your predecessor's crum bs). Seen on weekdays, around one p.m. , saluting with dignity Argus-eyed East while m aneuvering the car out of the garage and around the Page 92

dam ned evergreens, and down onto the slippery road. Raising a cold eye from book to clock in the positively sultry Beardsley Col ege library, am ong bulky young women caught and petrified in the overflow of hum an knowledge. W alking across the cam pus with the col ege clergym an, the Rev. Rigger (who also taught Bible in Beardsley School).

"Som ebody told me her mother was a celebrated actress kil ed in an airplane accident. Oh? M y mistake, I presum e. Is that so? I see. How sad." (Sublimating her mother, eh?) Slowly pushing my little pram through the labyrinth of the supermarket, in the wake of Professor W ., also a slow-m oving and gentle widower with the eyes of a goat. Shoveling the snow in my shirt-sleeves, a volum inous black and white muffler around my neck. Fol owing with no show of rapacious haste (even taking time to wipe my feet on the mat) my school-girl daughter into the house. Taking Dol y to the dentist-pretty nurse beam ing at her-old magazines-ne m ontrez pas vos zham bes. At dinner with Dol y in town, M r. Edgar H. Humbert was seen eating his steak in the continental knife-and-fork m anner. Enjoying, in duplicate, a concert: two marble-faced, becalmed Frenchm en sitting side by side, with M onsieur H. H.'s musical little girl on her father's right, and the musical little boy of Professor W . (father spending a hygienic evening in Providence) on M onsieur G. G.'s left. Opening the garage, a square of light that engulfs the car and is extinguished. Brightly pajam aed, jerking down the window shade in Dol y's bedroom . Saturday morning, unseen, solem nly weighing the winter-bleached lassie in the bathroom . Seen and heard Sunday morning, no chruchgoer after al , saying don't be too late, to Dol y who is bound for the covered court. Letting in a queerly observant schoolmate of Dol y's:

"First time I've seen a man wearing a sm oking jacket, sir-except in m ovies, of course." 9

Her girlfriends, whom I looked forward to m eet, proved on the whole disappointing. There was Opal Som ething, and Linda Hal , and Avis Chapm an, and Eva Rosen, and M

ona Dahl (save one, al these nam es are approximations, of course). Opal was a bashful, formless, bespectacled, bepimpled creature who doted on Dol y who bul ied her. W ith Linda Hal the school tennis cham pion, Dol y played singles at least twice a week: I suspect Linda was a true nym phet, but for som e unknown reason she did not com ewas perhaps not al owed to com e-to our house; so I recal her only as a flash of natural sunshine on an indoor court. Of the rest, none had any claims to nym phetry except Eva Rosen. Avis ws a plum p lateral child with hairy legs, while M ona, though handsom e in a coarse sensual way and only a year older than my aging mistress, had obviously long ceased to be a nym phet, if she ever had been one. Eva Rosen, a displaced little person from France, was on the other hand a good exam ple of a not strikingly beautiful child revealing to the perspicacious am ateur som e of the basic elem ents of nym phet charm, such as a perfect pubescent figure and lingering eyes and high cheekbones. Her glossy copper hair had Lolita's silkiness, and the features of her delicate milky-white face with pink lips and silverfish eyelashes were less foxy than those of her likes-the great clan of intra-racial redheads; nor did she sport their green uniform but wore, as I rem em ber her, a lot of black or cherry dark-a very sm art black pul over, for instance, and high-heeled black shoes, and garnet-red fingernail polish. I spoke French to her (much to Lo's disgust). The child's tonalities were stil adm irably pure, but for school words and play words she resorted to current American and then a slight Brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech, which was am using in a little Parisian who went to a select New England school with phoney British aspirations. Unfortunately, despite "that French kid's uncle" being "a mil ionaire," Lo dropped Eva for som e reason before I had had time to enjoy in my m odest way her fragrant presence in the Humbert open house. The reader knows what im portance I attached to having a bevy of page girls, consolation prize nym phets, around my Lolita. For a while, I endeavored to interest my senses in M ona Dahl who was a good Page 93

deal around, especial y during the spring term when Lo and she got so enthusiastic about dram atics. I have often wondered what secrets outrageously treacherous Dolores Haze had imparted to M ona while blurting out to me by urgent and wel -paid request various real y incredible details concerning an affair that M ona had had with a marine at the seaside. It was characteristic of Lo that she chose for her closest chum that elegant, cold, lascivious, experienced young fem ale whom I once heard (misheard, Lo swore) cheerful y say in the hal way to Lo-who had rem arked that her (Lo's) sweater was of virgin wool: "The only thing about you that is, kiddo . . ." She had a curiously husky voice, artificial y waved dul dark hair, earrings, am ber-brown prom inent eyes and luscious lips. Lo said teachers had rem onstrated with her on her loading herself with so much costum e jewelry. Her hands trem bled. She was burdened with a 150 I.Q. And I also knew she had a trem endous chocolate-brown mole on he womanish back which I inspected the night Lo and she had worn low-cut pastel-colored, vaporous dresses for a dance at the Butler Academ y.

I am anticipating a little, but I cannot help running my memory al over the keyboard of that shcool year. In the m eeting my attem pts to find out what kind of boys Lo knew, M iss Dahl was elegantly evasive. Lo who had gone to play tennis at Linda's country club had telephoned she might be a ful half hour late, and so, would I enteretain M ona who was com ing to practice with her a scene from The Tam ing of the Shrew. Using al the m odulations, al the al ure of m anner and voice she was capable of and staring at me with perhaps-could I be mistaken?-a faint gleam of crystal ine irony, beautiful M ona replied:

"W el , sir, the fact is Dol y is not much concerned with mere boys. Fact is, we are rivals. She and I have a crush on the Reverend Rigger." (This was a joke-I have already mentioned that gloom y giant of a man, with the jaw of a horse: he was to bore me to near murder with his impressions of Switzerland at a tea party for parents that I am unable to place correctly in terms of time.)

How had the bal been? Oh, it had been a riot. A what? A panic. Terrific, in a word. Had Lo danced a lot? Oh, not a frightful lot, just as much as she could stand. W hat did she, languorous M ona, think of Lo? Sir? Did she think Lo was doing wel at school? Gosh, she certainly was quite a kid. But her general behavior was-? Oh, she was a swel kid. But stil ? "Oh, she's a dol ," concluded M ona, and sighed abruptly, and picked up a book that happened to lie at hand, and with a change of expression, falsely furrowing her brow, inquired: "Do tel me about Bal Zack, sir. Is he real y that good?" She m oved up so close to my chair that I made out through lotions and cream s her uninteresting skin scent. A sudden odd thought stabbed me: was my Lo playing the pimp? If so, she had found the wrong substitute. Avoiding M ona' cool gaze, I talked literature for a minute. Then Dol y arrived-and slit her pale eyes at us. I left the two friends to their own devices. One of the latticed squares in a sm al cobwebby casem ent window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby, and that raw wound am ong the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical position-a night's m ove from the top-always strangely disturbed me. 10

Som etimes . . . Com e on, how often exactly, Bert? Can you recal four, five, more such occasions? Or would no hum an heart have survived two or three? Som etimes (I have nothing to say in reply to your question), while Lolita would be haphazardly preparing her hom ework, sucking a pencil, lol ing sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm, I would shed al my pedagogic restraint, dism iss al our quarrels, forget al my masculine pride-and literal y crawl on my knees to your chair, my Lolita! You would give me one look-a gray furry question mark of a look: "Oh no, not again" (incredulity, exasperation); for you never deigned to believe that I could, without any specific designs, ever crave to bury my face in your plaid skirt, my darling! The fragility of those bare arms of yours-how I longed to enfold them , al your four limpid lovely limbs, a folded Page 94

colt, and take your head between my unworthy hands, and pul the tem ple-skin back on both sides, and kiss your chinesed eyes, and-"Pulease, leave me alone, wil you," you would say, "for Christ's sake leave me alone." And I would get up from the floor while you looked on, your face deliberately twitching in imitation of my tic nerveux. But never mind, never mind, I am only a brute, never mind, let us go on with my miserable story. 11

One M onday forenoon, in Decem ber I think, Pratt asked me to com e over for a talk. Dol y's last report had been poor, I knew. But instead of contenting myself with som e such plausible explaination of this sum m ons, I imagined al sort of horrors, and had to fortify myself with a pint of my "pin" before I could face the interview. Slowly, al Adam's apple and heart, I went up the steps of the scaffold.

A huge women, gray-haired, frowsy, with a broad flat nose and sm al eyes behind blackrimmed

glasses-"Sit down," she said, pointing to an informal and hum iliating hassock, while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair. For a moment or two, she peered at me with sm iling curiosity.She had done it at our first m eeting, I recal ed, but I could afford then to scowl back. Her eye left me. She lapsed into thought-probably assum ed. M aking up her mind she rubbed, fold on fold, her dark gray flannel skirt at the knee, dispel ing a trace of chalk or som ething. Then she said, stil rubbing, not looking up:

"Let me ask a blunt question, M r. Haze. You are an old-fashioned Continental father, aren't you?"

"W hy, no," I said, "conservative, perhaps, but not what you would cal old-fashioned." She sighed, frowned, then clapped her big plum p hands together in a let's-get-downtobusiness m anner, and again fixed her beady eyes upon me.

"Dol y Haze," she said, "is a lovely child, but the onset of sexual maturing seem s to give her trouble."

I bowed slightly. W hat else could I do?

"She is stil shuttling," said M iss Pratt, showing how with her liver-spotted hands,

"between the anal and genital zones of developm ent. Basical y she is a lovely-"

"I beg your pardon," I said, "what zones?"

"That's the old-fashioned European in you!" cried Pratt delivering a slight tap on my wrist watch and suddenly disclosing her dentures. "Al I m ean is that biologic drives-do you sm oke?-are not fused in Dol y, do not fal so to speak into a-into a rounded pattern." Her hands held for a moment an invisible melon.

"She is attractive, birght though careless" (breathing heavily, without leaving her perch, the woman took time out to look at the lovely child's report sheet on the desk at her right).

"Her marks are getting worse and worse. Now I wonder, M r. Haze-" Again the false meditation.

"W el ," she went on with zest, "as for me, I do sm oke, and, as dear Dr. Pierce used to say: I'm not proud of it but I jeest love it." She lit up and the sm oke she exhaled from her nostrils was like a pair of tusks.

"Let me give you a few details, it won't take a moment. Now here let me see [rummaging am ong her papers]. She is defiant toward M iss Redcock and im possibly rude to M iss Cormorant. Now here is one of our special research reports: Enjoys singing with group in class though mind seem s to wander. Crosses her knees and wags left leg to rhythm .

Haze, her mother was-? Oh, I see. And you are-? Nobody's business is, I suppose, God's business. Som ething else we wanted to know. She was no regular hom e duties, I understand. M aking a princess of your Dol y, M r. Haze, he? W el , what else have we got here? Handles books graceful y. Voice pleasant. Giggles rather often. A little dream y. Has private jokes of her own, transposing for instance the first letters of som e of her teachers nam es. Hair light and dark brown, lustrous-wel [laughing] you are aware of that, I suppose. Nose unobstructed, feet high-arched, eyes-let me see, I had here som ewhere a stil more recent report. Aha, here we are. M iss Gold says Dol y's tennis form is excel ent to superb, even better than Linda Hal 's, but concentration and pointaccum ulation are just "poor to fair." M iss Cormorant cannot decide whether Dol y has exceptional em otional control or none at al . M iss Horn reports she-I m ean, Dol ycannot verbalize her em otions, while according to M iss Cole Dol y's metabolic efficiency is superfine. M iss M olar thinks Dol y is m yopic and should see a good ophthalmologist, but M iss Redcock insists that the girl simulates eye-strain to get away with scholastic incom petence. And to conclude, M r. Haze, our researchers are wondering about som ething real y crucial. Now I want to ask you som ething. I want to know if your poor wife, or yourself, or anyone else in the fam ily-I understand she has several aunts and a maternal grandfather in California?-oh, had!-I'm sorry-wel , we al wonder if anybody in the fam ily has instructed Dol y in the process of mammalian reproduction. The general impression is that fifteen-year-old Dol y rem ains morbidly uninterested in sexual matters, or to be exact, represses her curiosity in order to save her ignorance and self-dignity. Al right-fourteen. You see, M r. Haze, Beardsley School does not believe in bees and blossom s, and storks and love birds, but it does believe very strongly in preparing its students for mutual y satisfactory mating and successful child rearing. W e feel Dol y could make excel ent progress if only she would put her mind to her work. M iss Cormorant's report is significant in that respect. Dol y is inclined to be, mildly speaking im pudent. But al feel that primo, you should have your fam ily doctor tel her the facts of life and, secudno, that you al ow her to enjoy the com pany of her schoolmates' brothers at the Junior Club or in Dr. Rigger's organization, or in the lovely hom es of our parents."

"She may m eet boys at her own lovely hom e," I said.

"I hope she wil ," said Pratt buoyantly. "W hen we questioned her about her troubles, Dol y refused to discuss the hom e situation, but we have spoken to som e of her friends and real y-wel , for exam ple, we insist you un-veto her nonparticiaption in the dram atic group. You just must al ow her to tak part in The Hunted Enchanters. She was such a perfect little nym ph in the try-out, and som etime in spring the author wil stay for a few days at Beardsley Col ege and may attend a rehearsal or two in our new auditorium . I m ean it is al part of the fun of being young and alive and beautiful. You must understand-"

"I always thought of myself," I said, "as a very understanding father."

"Oh, no doubt, no doubt, but M iss Cormorant thinks, and I am inclined to agree with her, that Dol y is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet, and wil tease and martyrize other girls, or even our younger instructors because they do have innocent dates with boys."

"Shrugged my shoulders. A shabby Ã©m igrÃ©.

"Let us put our two heads together, M r. Haze. W hat on earth is wrong with that child?"

"She seem s quite normal and happy to me," I said (disaster com ing at last? W as I found out? Had they got som e hypnotist?).

"W hat worries me," said M iss Pratt looking at her watch and starting to go over the Page 96

whole subject again, "is that both teachers and schoolmates find Dol y antagonistic, dissatisfied, cagey-and everybody wonders why you are so firly opposed to al the natural recreations of a normal child."

"Do you m ean sex play?" I asked jauntily, in despair, a cornered old rat.

"W el , I certainly welcom e this civilized terminology," said Pratt with a grin. "But this is not quite the point. Under the auspices of Beardsley School, dram atics, dances and other natural activities are not technical y sex play, though girls do m eet boys, if that is what you object to."

"Al right," I said, my hassock exhaling a weary sign. "You win. She can take part in that play. Provided male parts are taken by fem ale parts."

"I am always fascinated," said Pratt, "by the adm irable way foreigners-or at least naturalized Americans-use our rich language. I'm sure M iss Gold, who conducts the play group, wil be overjoyed. I notice she is one of the few teachers that seem to like-I m ean who seem to find Dol y m anageable. This takes care of general topics, I guess; now com es a special matter. W e are in trouble again."

Pratt paused truculently, then rubbed her index finger under her nostrils with such vigor that her nose performed a kind of war dance.

"I'm a frank person," she said, "but conventions are conventions, and I find it difficult . . . Let me put it this way . . . The W alkers, who live in what we cal around here the Duke's M anor, you know the great gray house on the hil -they send their two girls to our school, and we have the niece of President M oore with us, a real y gracious child, not to speak of a num ber of other prom inent children. W el , under the circum stances, it is rather a jolt when Dol y, who looks like a little lady, uses words which you as a foreigner probably simply do not know or do not understand. Perhaps it might be better-W ould you like me to have Dol y com e up here right away to discuss things? No? You see-oh wel , let's have it out. Dol y has written a most obscene four-letter word which our Dr. Cutler tel s me is low-M exican for urinal with her lipstick on som e health pam phlets which M iss Redcock, who is getting married in June, distributed am ong the girls, and we thought she should stay after hours-another half hour at least. But if you like-"

"No," I said, "I don't want to interfere with rules. I shal talk to her later. I shal thrash it out."

"Do," said the woman rising from her chair arm. "And perhaps we can get together again soon, and if things do not improve we might have Dr. Cutler analyze her." Should I marry Pratt and strangle her?

". . .And perhaps your fam ily doctor might like to exam ine her physical y-just a routine check-up. She is in M ushroom - the last classroom along that passage." Beardsley School, it may be explained, copied a fam ous girls school in England by having

"traditional" nicknam es for its various classroom s: M ushroom , Room -In 8, BRoom

, Room -BA and so on. M ushroom was sm el y, with a sepia print of Reynolds' "Age of Innocence" above the chalkboard, and several rows of clum sy-looking pupil desks. At one of these, my Lolita was reading the chapter on "Dialogue" in Baker's Dram atic Technique, and al was very quiet, and there was another girl with a very naked, porcelain-white neck and wonderful platinum hair, who sat in front reading too, absolutely lost to the world and interminably winding a soft curl around one finger, and I sat beside Dol y just behind that neck and that hair, and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixty-five cents plus the permission to participate in the school play, had Dol y put her inky, chalky, red-knuckled hand under the desk. Oh, stupid and reckless of me, no doubt, but after the torture I had been subjected to, I simply had to take advantage of a com bination that I knew would never occur again.

Around Christmas she caught a bad chil and was exam ined by a friend of M iss Lester, a Page 97

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

Dr. Ilse Tristram son (hi, Ilse, you were a dear, uninquisitive soul, and you touched my dove very gently). She diagnosed bronchitis, patted Lo on the back (al its bloom erect because of the fever) and put her to bed for a week or longer. At first she "ran a tem perature" in American parlance, and I could not resist the exquisite caloricity of unexpected delights-Venus febriculosa-though it was a very languid Lolita that m oaned and coughed and shivered in my em brace. And as soon as she was wel again, I threw a Party with Boys.

Perhaps I had drunk a little too much in preparation for the ordeal. Perhaps I made a fool of myself. The girls had decorated and plugged in a sm al fir tree-German custom , except that colored bulbs had superseded wax candles. Records were chosen and fed into my landlord's phonograph. Chic Dol y wore a nice gray dress with fitted bodice and flared skirt. Humming, I retired to my study upstairs-and then every ten or twenty minutes I would com e down like an idiot just for a few seconds; to pick up ostensibly my pipe from the mantelpiece or hunt for the newspaper; and with every new visit these simple actions becam e harder to perform, and I was rem inded of the dreadful y distant days when I used to brace myself to casual y enter a room in the Ram sdale house where Little Carmen was on.

The party was not a success. Of the three girls invited, one did not com e at al , and one of the boys brought his cousin Roy, so there was a superfluity of two boys, and the cousins knew al the steps, and the other fel ows could hardly dance at al , and most of the evening was spent in m essing up the kitchen, and then endlessly jabbering about what card gam e to play, and som etime later, two girls and four boys sat on the floor of the living room , with al windows open, and played a word gam e which Opal could not be made to understand, while M ona and Roy, a lean handsom e lad, drank ginger ale in the kitchen, sitting on the table and dangling their legs, and hotly discussing Predestination and the Law of Averages. After they had al gone my Lo said ugh, closed her eyes, and dropped into a chair with al four limbs starfished to express the utmost disgust and exhaustion and swore it was the most revolting bunch of boys she had ever seen. I bought her a new tennis racket for that rem ark.

January was hum id and warm, and February fooled the forsythia: none of the townspeople had ever seen such weather. Other presents cam e tum bling in. For her birthday I bought her a bicycle, the doe-like and altogether charming m achine already mentioned-and added to this a History of M odern American Painting: her bicycle m anner, I m ean her approach to it, the hip m ovem ent in m ounting, the grace and so on, afforded me suprem e pleasure; but my attem pt to refine her pictorial taste was a failure; she wanted to know if the guy noon-napping on Doris Lee's hay was the father of the pseudo-voluptuous hoyden in the foreground, and could not understand why I said Grant W ood or Peter Hurd was good, and Reginald M arsh or Frederick W augh awful. 13

By the time spring had touched up Thayer Street with yel ow and green and pink, Lolita was irrevocably stage-struck. Pratt, whom I chanced to notice one Sunday lunching with som e people at W alton Inn, caught my eye from afar and went through the motion of sym pathetical y and discreetly clapping her hands while Lo was not looking. I detest the theatre as being a primitive and putrid form, historical y speaking; a form that sm acks of stone-age rites and com m unal nonsense despite those individual injections of genius, such as, say, Elizabethan poetry which a closeted reader autom atical y pum ps out of the stuff. Being much occupied at the time with my own literary labors, I did not bother to read the com plete text of The Enchanted Hunters, the playlet in which Dolores Haze was assigned the part of a farmer's daughter who imagines herself to be a woodland witch, or Diana, or som ething, and who, having got hold of a book on hypnotism , plunges a num ber of lost hunters into various entertaining trances before fal ing in her turn under Page 98

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

the spel of a vagabond poet (M ona Dahl). That much I gleaned from bits of crum pled and poorly typed script that Lo sowed al over the house. The coincidence of the title with the nam e of an unforgettable inn was pleasant in a sad little way: I wearily thought I had better not bring it to my own enchantress's notice, lest a brazen accusation of mawkishness hurt me even more than her failure to notice it for herself had done. I assum ed the playlet was just another, practical y anonym ous, version of som e banal legend. Nothing prevented one, of course, from supposing that in quest of an attractive nam e the founder of the hotel had been immediately and solely influenced by the chance fantasy of the second-rate muralist he had hired, and that subsequently the hotel's nam e had suggested the play's title. But in my credulous, simple, benevolent mind I happened to twist it the other way round, and without giving the whole matter much though real y, supposed that mural, nam e and title had al been derived from a com m on source, from som e local tradition, which I, an alien unversed in New England lore, would not be supposed to know. In consequence I was under the impression (al this quite casual y, you understand, quite outside my orbit of im portance) that the accursed playlet belonged to the type of whimsy for juvenile consum ption, arranged and rearranged many times, such as Hansel and Gretel by Richard Roe, or The Sleeping Beauty by Dorothy Doe, or The Em peror's New Clothes by M aurice Verm ont and M arion Rum pelmeyer-al this to be found in any Plays for School Actors or Let's Have a Play! In other words, I did not know-and would not have cared, if I did - that actual y The Enchanted Hunters was a quite recent and technical y original com position which had been produced for the first time only three or four m onths ago by a highbrow group in New York. To me-inasm uch as I could judge from my charmer's part-it seem ed to be a pretty dism al kind of fancy work, with echoes from Lenorm and and M aeterlinck and various quiet British dream ers. The red-capped, uniformly attired hunters, of which one was a banker, another a plum ber, a third a policem an, a fourth an undertaker, a fifth an underwriter, a sixth an escaped convict (you see the possibilities!), went through a com plete change of mind in Dol y's Del , and rem em bered their real lives only as dream s or nightmares from which little Diana had aroused them ; but a seventh Hunter (in a green cap, the fool) was a Young Poet, and he insisted, much to Diana's annoyance, that she and the entertainm ent provided (dancing nym phs, and elves, and m onsters) were his, the Poet's, invention. I understand that final y, in utter disgust at his cocksureness, barefooted Dolores was to lead check-trousered M ona to the paternal farm behind the Perilous Forest to prove to the braggart she was not a poet's fancy, but a rustic, down-to-brown-earth lass-and a lastminute kiss was to enforce the play's profound m essage, nam ely, that mirage and reality merge in love. I considered it wiser not to criticize the thing in front of Lo: she was so healthily engrossed in "problem s of expression," and so charmingly did she put her narrow Florentine hands together, batting her eyelashes and pleading with me not to com e to rehearsals as som e ridiculous parents did because she wanted to dazzle me with a perfect First Night-and because I was, anyway, always butting in and saying the wrong thing, and cram ping her style in the presence of other people. There was one very special rehearsal . . . my heart, my heart . . . there was one day in M ay marked by a lot of gay flurry-it al rol ed past, beyond my ken, im m une to my memory, and when I saw Lo next, in the late afternoon, balancing on her bike, pressing the palm of her hand to the dam p bark of a young birch tree on the edge of our lawn, I was so struck by the radiant tenderness of her sm ile that for an instant I believed al our troubles gone. "Can you rem em ber," she said, "what was the nam e of that hotel, you know [nose pucketed], com e on, you know-with those white colum ns and the marble swan in the lobby? Oh, you know

[noisy exhalation of breath]-the hotel where you raped me. Okay, skip it. I m ean, was it

[almost in a whisper] The Enchanted Hunters?

Oh, it was? [musingly] W as it?"-and with a yelp of am orous vernal laughter she slapped Page 99

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

the glossy bole and tore uphil , to the end of the street, and then rode back, feet at rest on stopped pedals, posture relaxed, one hand dream ing in her print-flowered lap. 14

Because it supposedly tied up with her interest in dance and dram atics, I had permitted Lo to take piano lessons with a M iss Em peror (as we French scholars may conveniently cal her) to whose blue-shuttered little white house a mile or so beyond Beardsley Lo would spin off twice a week. One Friday night toward the end of M ay (and a week or so after the very special rehearsal Lo had not had me attend) the telephone in my study, where I was in the act of m opping up Gustave's-I m ean Gaston's-king's side, rang and M iss Em peror asked if Lo was com ing next Tuesday because she had missed last Tuesday's and today's lessons. I said she would by al m eans-and went on with the gam e. As the reader may wel imagine, my faculties were now impaired, and a m ove or two later, with Gaston to play, I noticed through the film of my general distress that he could col ect my queen; he noticed it too, but thinking it might be a trap on the part of his tricky opponent, he dem urred for quite a minute, and puffed and wheezed, and shook his jowls, and even shot furtive glances at me, and made hesitating half-thrusts with his pudgily bunched fingers-dying to take that juicy queen and not daring-and al of a sudden he swooped down upon it (who knows if it did not teach him certain later audacities?), and I spent a dreary hour in achieving a draw. He finished his brandy and presently lum bered away, quite satisfied with this result (m on pauvre am i, je ne vous ai jam ais revu et quoiqu'il y ait bien peu de chance que vous voyiez m on livre, permiettezmoi de vous dire que je vous serre la main bien cordialem ent, et que toutes mes fil ettes vous saluent). I found Dolores Haze at the kitchen table, consum ing a wedge of pie, with her eyes fixed on her script. They rose to m eet mine with a kind of celestial vapidity. She rem ained singularly unruffled when confronted with my discovery, and said d'un petit air faussem ent contrit that she knew she was a very wicked kid, but simply had not been able to resist the enchantment, and had used up those music hours-O Reader, M y Reader!-in a nearby public park rehearsing the magic forest scene with M ona. I said

"fine"-and stalked to the telephone. M ona's mother answered: "Oh yes, she's in" and retreated with a mother's neutral laugh of polite pleasure to shout off stage "Roy cal ing!" and the very next moment M ona rustled up, and forthwith, in a low m onotonous not untender voice started berating Roy for som ething he had said or done and I interrupted her, and presently M ona was saying in her hum bles, sexiest contralto, "yes, sir," "surely, sir" "I am alone to blam e, sir, in this unfortunate business," (what elocution! what poise!)

"honest, I feel very bad about it"-and so on and so forth as those little harlots say. So downstairs I went clearing my throat and holding my heart. Lo was now in the living room

, in her favorite overstuffed chair. As she sprawled there, biting at a hangnail an mocking me with her heartless vaporous eyes, and al the time rocking a stool upon which she had placed the heel of an outstretched shoeless foot, I perceived al at once with a sickening qualm how much she had changed since I first met her two years ago. Or had this happened during those last two weeks? Tendresse? Surely that was an exploded myth. She sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger. The fog of al lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity. Oh, she had changed! Her com plexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosm etics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate epidermis com es in contact with her skin. Its sm ooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when I used to rol , in play, her tousled head on my knee. A coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence. W hat was local y known as a "rabbit cold" had painted with flam ing pink the edges of her contem ptuous nostrils. As in terror I lowered my gaze, it m echanical y slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thigh-how polished and muscular her legs had Page 100

grown! She kept her wide-set eyes, clouded-glass gray and slightly bloodshot, fixed upon me, and I saw the stealthy thought showing through them that perhaps after al M

ona was right, and she, orphan Lo, could expose me without getting penalized herself. How wrong I was. How mad I was! Everything about her was of the sam e exasperating im penetrable order-the strength of her shapely legs, the dirty sole of her white sock, the thick sweater she wore despite the closeness of the room , her wenchy sm el , and especial y the dead end of her face with its strange flush and freshly made-up lips. Som e of the red had left stains on her front teeth, and I was struck by a ghastly recol ection-the evoked image not of M onique, but of another young prostitute in a bel -house, ages ago, who had been snapped up by som ebody else before I had time to decide whether her mere youth warranted my risking som e appal ing disease, and who had just such flushed prom inent pommettes and a dead maman, and big front teeth, and a bit of dingy red ribbon in her country-brown hair.

"W el , speak," said Lo. "W as the corroboration satisfactory?"

"Oh, yes," I said. "Perfect. yes. And I do not doubt you two made it up. As a matter of fact, I do not doubt you have told her everything about us."

"Oh, yah?"

I control ed my breath and said: "Dolores, this must stop right away. I am ready to yank you out of Beardsley and lock you up you know where, but this must stop. I am ready to take you away the time it takes to pack a suitcase. This must stop or else anything may happen."

"Anything may happen, huh?"

I snatched away the stool she was rocking with her heel and her foot fel with a thud on the floor.

"Hey," she cried, "take it easy."

"First of al you go upstairs," I cried in my turn,-and simultaneously grabbed at her and pul ed her up. From that moment, I stopped restraining my voice, and we continued yel ing at each other, and she said, unprintable things. She said she loathed me. She made m onstrous faces at me, inflating her cheeks and producing a diabolical plopping sound. She said I had attem pted to violate her several times when I was her mother's room er. She said she was sure I had murdered her mother. She said she would sleep with the very first fel ow who asked her and I could do nothing about it. I said she was to go upstairs and show me al her hiding places. It was a strident and hateful scene. I held her by her knobby wrist and she kept turning and twisting it this way and that, surreptitiously trying to find a weak point so as to wrench herself free at a favorable moment, but I held her quite hard and in fact hurt her rather badly for which I hope my heart may rot, and once or twice she jerked her arm so violently that I feared her wrist might snap, and al the while she stared at me with those unforgettable eyes where could anger and hot tears struggled, and our voices were drowning the telephone, and when I grew aware of its ringing she instantly escaped.

W ith people in m ovies I seem to share the services of the m achina telephonica and its sudden god. This time it was an irate neighbor. The east window happened to be agape in the living room , with the blind merciful y down, however; and behind it the dam p black night of a sour New England spring had been breathlessly listening to us. I had always thought that type of haddocky spinster with the obscene mind was the result of considerable literary inbreeding in m odern fiction; but now I am convinced that prude and prurient M iss East-or to explode her incognito, M iss Fenton Lebone-had been probably protruding three-quarter-way from her bedroom window as she strove to catch the gist of our quarrel.

I apologized for my daughter's friends being so loud. Young people, you know-and cradled the next quack and a half.

Downstairs the screen door banged. Lo? Escaped?

Through the casem ent on the stairs I saw a sm al impetuous ghost slip through the shrubs; a silvery dot in the dark-hub of the bicycle wheel-m oved, shivered, and she was gone. It so happened that the car was spending the night in a repair shop downtown. I had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged fugitive. Even now, after more than three years have heaved and elapsed, I cannot visualize that spring-night street, that already so leafy street, without a gasp of panic. Before their lighted porch M iss Lester was prom enading M iss Favian's dropsical dackel. M r. Hyde almost knocked it over. W

alk three steps and runt three. A tepid rain started to drum on the chestnut leaves. At the next corner, pressing Lolita against an iron railing, a blurred youth held and kissed-no, not her, mistake. M y talons stil tingling, I flew on. Half a mile or so east of num ber fourteen, Thayer Street tangles with a private lane and a cross street; the latter leads to the town proper; in front of the first drugstore, I saw-with what melody of relief!-Lolita's fair bicycle waiting for her. I pushed instead of pul ing, pul ed, pushed, pul ed, and entered. Look out! som e ten paces away Lolita, though the glass of a telephone booth (membranous god stil with us), cupping the tube, confidential y hunched over it, slit her eyes at me, turned away with her treasure, hurriedly hung up, and walked out with a flourish.

"Tried to reach you at hom e," she said brightly. "A great decision has been made. But first buy me a drink, dad."

She watched the listless pale fountain girl put in the ice, pour in the coke, add the cherry syrup-and my heart was bursting with love-ache. That childish wrist. M y lovely child. You have a lovely child, M r. Humbert. W e always adm ire her as she passes by. M r. Pim watched Pippa suck in the concoction.

J'ai toujours adm irÃ© l'aeuvre du sublime dublinois. And in the m eantime the rain had becom e a voluptuous shower.

"Look," she said as she rode the bike beside me, one foot scraping the darkly glistening sidewalk, "look, I've decided som ething. I want to leave school I hate that school I hate the play, I real y do! Never go back. Find another. Leave at once. Go for a long trip again. But this time we'l go wherever I want, won't we?" I nodded. M y Lolita.

"I choose? C'est entendu?" she asked wobbling a little beside me. Used French only when she was a very good little girl.

"Okay. Entendu. Now hop-hop-hop, Lenore, or you'l get soaked." (A storm of sobs was fil ing my chest.)

She bared her teeth and after her adorable school-girl fashioned, leaned forward, and away she sped, my bird.

M iss Lester's finely groom ed hand held a porch-door open for a waddling old dog qui prenait son tem ps.

Lo was waiting for me near the ghostly birch tree.

"I am drenched," she declared at the top of her voice. "Are you glad? To hel with the play! See what I m ean?"

An invisible hag's claw slammed down an upper-floor window.

In our hal way, ablaze with welcom ing lights, my Lolita peeled off her sweater, shook her gemmed hair, stretched towards me two bare arms, raised one knee:

"Carry me upstairs, please. I feel sort of rom antic tonight." It may interest physiologists to learn, at this point, that I have the ability-a most singular case, I presum e-of shedding torrents of tears throughout the other tem pest. 15

The brakes were relined, the waterpipes unclogged, the valves ground, and a num ber of other repairs and improvem ents were paid for by not very m echanical y-minded but prudent papa Humbert, so that the late M rs. Humbert's car was in respectable shape when ready to undertake a new journey.

W e had prom ised Beardsley School, good old Beardsley School, that we would be back as soon as my Hol ywood engagem ent cam e to an end (inventive Humbert was to be, I hinted, chief consultant in the production of a film dealing with "existentialism ," stil a hot thing at the time). Actual y I was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the M

exican border-I was braver now than last year-and there deciding what to do with my little concubine who was now sixty inches tal and weighed ninety pounds. W e had dug out our tour books and maps. She had traced our route with immense zest. W as it thanks to those theatricals that she had now outgrown her juvenile jaded airs and was so adorably keen to explore rich reality? I experienced the queer lightness of dream s that pale but warm Sunday morning when we abandoned Professor Chem 's puzzled house and sped along M ain Street toward the four-lane highway. M y Love's striped, black-andwhite cotton frock, jauntry blue with the large beautiful y cut aquam arine on a silver chainlet, which gemmed her throat: a spring rain gift from me. W e passed the New Hotel, and she laughed. "A penny for your thoughts," I said and she stretched out her palm at once, but at that moment I had to apply the breaks rather abruptly at a red light. As we pul ed up, another car cam e to a gliding stop alongside, and a very striking looking, athletical y lean young woman (where had I seen her?) with a high com plexion and shoulder-length bril iant bronze hair, greeted Lo with a ringing "Hi!"-and then, addressing me, effusively, edusively (placed!), stressing certain words, said: "W hat a sham e to was to tear Dol y away from the play-you should have heard the author raving about her after that rehearsal-" "Green light, you dope," said Lo under her breath, and simultaneously, waving in bright adieu a bangled arm, Joan of Arc (in a perform ance we saw at the local theatre) violently outdistanced us to swerve into Cam pus Avenue.

"W ho was it exactly? Verm ont or Rum pelmeyer?"

"No-Edusa Gold-the gal who coaches us."

"I was not referring to her. W ho exactly concocted that play?"

"Oh! Yes, of course. Som e old woman, Clare Som ething, I guess. There was quite a crowd of them there."

"So she com plimented you?"

"Com plimented my eye-she kissed me on my pure brow"-and my darling em itted that new yelp of merriment which-perhaps in connection with her theatrical m annerism s-she had lately begun to affect.

"You are a funny creature, Lolita," I said-or som e such words. "Natural y, I am overjoyed you gave up that absurd stage business. But what is curious is that you dropped the whole thing only a week before its natural climax. Oh, Lolita, you should be careful of those surrenders of yours. I rem em ber you gave up Ram sdale for cam p, and cam p for a joyride, and I could list other abrupt changes in your disposition. You must be careful. There are things that should never be given up. You must persevere. You should try to be a little nicer to me, Lolita. You should also watch your diet. The tour of your thigh, you know, should not exceed seventeen and a half inches.

conifers, le m ontagnard Ã©m igrÃ© in his bear skin glory, and Felis tigris goldsm ithi, and Red Indians under the catalpas. That it al boiled down to a m easly suburban lawn and a sm oking garbage incinerator, was appal ing. Farewel , Appalachia! Leaving it, we crossed Ohio, the three states beginning with "I," and Nebraska-ah, that first whiff of the W est! W e traveled very leisurely, having more than a week to reach W ace, Continental Divide, where she passionately desired to see he Cerem onial Dances marking the seasonal opening of M agic Cave, and at least three weeks to reach Elphinstone, gem of a western State where she yearned to climb Red Rock from which a mature screen star had recently jum ped to her death after a drunken row with her gigolo. Again we were welcom ed to wary motels by m eans of inscriptions that read:

"W e wish you feel at hom e while here. Al equipm ent was careful y checked upon your arrival. Your license num ber is on record here. Use hot water sparingly. W e reserve the right to eject without notice any objectionable person. Do not throw waste material of any kind in the toilet bowl. Thank you. Cal again. The M anagem ent. P.S. W e consider our guests the Finest People of the W orld."

In these frightening places we paid ten for twins, flies queued outside at the screenless door and successful y scram bled in, the ashes of our predecessors stil lingered in the ashtrays, a woman's hair lay on the pil ow, one heard one's neighbor hanging his coat in his closet, the hangers were ingeniously fixed to their bars by coils of wire so as to thwart theft, and, in crowning insult, the pictures above the twin beds were identical twins. I also noticed that commercial fashion was changing. There was a tendency for cabins to fuse and gradual y form the caravansary, and, lo (she was not interested but the reader may be), a second story was added, and a lobby grew in, and cars were rem oved to a com m unal garage, and the motel reverted to the good old hotel. I now warn the reader not to mock me and my mental daze. It is easy for him and me to decipher now a past destiny; but a destiny in the making is, believe me, not one of those honest mystery stories where al you have to do is keep an eye on the clues. In my youth I once read a French detective tale where the clues were actual y in italics; but that is not M cFate's way-even if one does learn to recognize certain obscure indications. For instance: I would not swear that there was not at least one occasion, prior to, or at the very beginning of, the M idwest lap of our journey, when she m anaged to convey som e information to, or otherwise get into contact with, a person or persons unknown. W e had stopped at a gas station, under the sign of Pegasus, and she had slipped out of her seat and escaped to the rear of the prem ises while the raised hood, under which I had bent to watch the m echanic's manipulations, hid her for a moment from my sight. Being inclined to be lenient, I only shook my benign head though strictly speaking such visits were taboo, since I felt instinctively that toilets-as also telephones-happened to be, for reasons unfathom able, the points where my destiny was liable to catch. W e al have such fateful objects-it may be a recurrent landscape in one case, a num ber in another-careful y chosen by the gods to attract events of special significance for us: here shal John always stum ble; there shal Jane's heart always break.

W el -my car had been attended to, and I had m oved it away from the pum ps to let a pickup truck be serviced-when the growing volum e of her absence began to weigh upon me in the windy grayness. Not for the first time, and not for the last, had I stared in such dul discom fort of mind at those stationary trivialities that look almost surprised, like staring rustics, to find them selves in the stranded traveler's field of vision: that green garbage can, those very black, very whitewal ed tires for sale, those bright cans of motor oil, that red icebox with assorted drinks, the four, five, seven discarded bottles within the incom pleted crossword puzzle of their wooden cel s, that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window of the office. Radio music was com ing from its open door, and because the rhythm was not synchronized with the heave and flutter and other gestures of Page 104

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

wind-animated vegetation, one had the impression of an old scenic film living its own life while piano or fiddle fol owed a line of music quite outside the shivering flower, the swaying branch. The sound of Charlotte's last sob incongruously vibrated through me as, with her dress fluttering athwart the rhythm , Lolita veered from a total y unexpected direction. She had found the toilet occupied and had crossed over to the sign of the Conche in the next block. They said there they were proud of their hom e-clean restroom s. These prepaid postcards, they said, had been provided for your comments. No postcards. No soap. Nothing. No comments.

That day or the next, after a tedious drive through a land of food crops, we reached a pleasant little burg and put up at Chestnut Court-nice cabins, dam p green grounds, apple trees, an old swing-and a trem endous sunset which the tried child ignored. She had wanted to go through Kasbeam because it was only thirty miles north from her hom e town but on the fol owing morning I found her quite listless, with no desire to see again the sidewalk where she had played hopscotch som e five years before. For obvious reasons I had rather dreaded that side trip, even though we had agreed not to make ourselves conspicuous in any way-to rem ain in the car and not look up old friends. M y relief at her abandoning the project was spoiled by the thought that had she felt I were total y against the nostalgic possibilities of Pisky, as I had been last year, she would not have given up so easily. On my mentioning this with a sigh, she sighed too and com plained of being out of sorts. She wanted to rem ain in bed til teatime at least, with lots of magazines, and then if she felt better she suggested we just continue westward. I must say she was very sweet and languid, and craved for fresh fruits, and I decided to go and fetch her a toothsom e picnic lunch in Kasbeam . Our cabin stood on the timbered crest of a hil , and from our window you could see the road winding down, and then running as straight as a hair parting between two rows of chestnut trees, towards the pretty town, which looked singularly distinct and toylike in the pure morning distance. One could make out an elf-like girl on an insect-like bicycle, and a dog, a bit too large proportionately, al as clear as those pilgrims and mules winding up wax-pale roads in old paintings with blue hil s and red little people. I have the European urge to use my feet when a drive can be dispensed with, so I leisurely walked down, eventual y m eeting the cyclist-a plain plum p girl with pigtails, fol owed by a huge St. Bernard dog with orbits like pansies. In Kasbeam a very old barber gave me a very mediocre haircut: he babbled of a basebal -playing son of his, and, at every explodent, spat into my neck, and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheet-wrap, or interrupted his trem ulous scissor work to produce faded newspaper clippings, and so inattentive was I that it cam e as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easeled photograph am ong the ancient gray lotions, that the mustached young bal player had been dead for the last thirty years. I had a cup of hot flavorless coffee, bought a bunch of bananas for my m onkey, and spent another ten minutes or so in a delicatessen store. At least an hour and a half must have elapsed when this hom eward-bound little pilgrim appeared on the winding road leading to Chestnut Castle.

The girl I had seen on my way to town was now loaded with linen and engaged in helping a misshapen man whose big head and coarse features rem inded me of the "Bertoldo" character in low Italian com edy. They were cleaning the cabins of which there was a dozen or so on Chestnut Crest, al pleasantly spaced am id the copious verdure. It was noon, and most of them , with a final bang of their screen doors, had already got rid of their occupants. A very elderly, almost mummy-like couple in a very new m odel were in the act of creeping out of one of the contiguous garages; from another a red hood protruded in som ewhat cod-piece fashion; and nearer to our cabin, a strong and handsom e young man with a shock of black hair and blue eyes was putting a portable refrigerator into a station wagon. For som e reason he gave me a sheepish grin as I passed. On the Page 105

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

grass expanse opposite, in the many-limbed hsade of luxuriant trees, the fam iliar St. Bernard dog was guarding his mistress' bicycle, and nearby a young woman, far gone in the fam ily way, had seated a rapt baby on a swing and was rocking it gently, while a jealous boy of two or three was making a nuisance of himself by trying to push or pul the swing board; he final y succeeded in getting himself knocked down by it, and bawled loudly as he lay supine on the grass while his mother continued to sm ile gently at neither of her present children. I recal so clearly these miniatiae probably because I was to check my impressions so thoroughly only a few minutes later; and besides, som ething in me had been on guard ever since that awful night in Beardsley. I now refused to be diverted by the feeling of wel -being that my walk had engendered-by the young summer breeze that enveloped the nape of my neck, the giving crrunch of the dam n gravel, the juice tidbit. I had sucked out at last from a hol owy tooth, and even the com fortable weight of my provisions which the general condition of my heart should not have al owed me to carry; but even that miserable pum p of mine seem ed to be working sweetly, and I felt adolori d'am oureuse langueur, to quote dear old Ronsard, as I reached the cottage where I had left my Dolores.

To my surprise I found her dressed. She was sitting on the edge of the bed in slacks and T-shirt, and was looking at me as if she could not quite place me. The frank soft shape of her sm al breasts was brought out rather than blurred by the lim pness of her thin shirt, and this frankness irritated me. She had not washed; yet her m outh was freshly though sm udgily painted, and her broad teeth glistened like wine-tinged ivory, or pinkish poker chips. And there she sat, hands clasped in her lap, and dream ily brimmed with a diabolical glow that had no relations to me whatever.

I plum ped down my heavy paper bag and stood staring at the bare ankles of her sandaled feet, then at her sil y face, then again at her sinful feet. "You've been out," I said (the sandals were filthy with gravel).

"I just got up," she replied, and added upon intercepting my downward glance: "W ent out for a sec. W anted to see if you were com ing back."

She becam e aware of the bananas and uncoiled herself tableward. W hat special suspicion could I have? None indeed-but those m uddy, m oony eyes of hers, that singular warmth em anating from her! I said nothing. I looked at the road m eandering so distinctly within the fram e of the window. . . Anybody wishing to betray my trust would have found it a splendid lookout. W ith rising appetite, Lo applied herself to the fruit. Al at once I rem em bered the ingratiating grin of the Johnny next door. I stepped out quickly. Al cars had disappeared except his station wagon; his pregnant young wife was not getting into it with her baby and the other, more or less canceled, child.

"W hat's the matter, where are you going?" cried Lo from the porch. I said nothing. I pushed her softness back into the room and went in after her. I ripped her shirt off. I unzipped the rest of her, I tore off her sandals. W ildly, I pursued the shadow of her infidelity; but the scent I traveled upon was so slight as to be practical y undistinguishable from a madman's fancy.

Gros Gaston, in his prissy way, had liked to make presents-presents just a prissy wee bit out of the ordinary, or so he prissily thought. Noticing one night that my box of chessm en was broken, he sent me next morning, with a little lad of his, a copper case: it had an elaborate Oriental design over the lid and could be securely locked. Once glance sufficed to assure me that it was one of those cheap m oney boxes cal ed for som e reason

"luizettas" that you buy in Algiers and elsewhere, and wonder what to do with afterwards. It turned out to be much too flat for holding my bulky chessm en, but I kept it-using it for a total y different purpose.

Page 106

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

In order to break som e pattern of fate in which I obscurely felt myself being enm eshed, I had decided-despite Lo's visible annoyance-to spend another night at Chestnut Court; definitely waking up at four in the morning, I ascertained that Lo was stil sound asleep (m outh open, in a kind of dul am azem ent at the curiously inane life we al had rigged up for her) and satisfied myself that the precious contents of the "luizetta" were safe. There, snugly wrapped in a white woolen scarf, lay a pocket autom atic: caliber .32, capacity of magazine 8 cartridges, length a little under one ninth of Lolita's length, stock checked walnut, finish ful blued. I had inherited it from the late Harold Haze, with a 1938 catalog which cheerily said in part: "Particularly wel adapted for use in the hom e and car as wel as on the person." There it lay, ready for instant service on the person or persons, loaded and ful y cocked with the slide lock in safety position, thus precluding any accidental discharge. W e must rem em ber that a pistol is the Freudian sym bol of the Ur-father's central forelimb.

I was now glad I had it with m e-and even more glad that I had learned to use it two years before, in the pine forest around my and Charlotte's glass lake. Farlow, with whom I had roam ed those rem ote woods, was an adm irable marksm an, and with his .38 actual y m anaged to hit a hummingbird, though I must say not much of it could be retrieved for proof-only a little iridescent fluff. A burley ex-policem an cal ed Krestovski, who in the twenties had shot and kil ed two escaped convicts, joined us and bagged a tiny woodpecker-com pletely out of season, incidental y. Between those two sportsm en I of course was a novice and kept missing everything, though I did would a squirrel on a later occasion when I went out alone. "You like here," I whispered to my light-weight com pact little chum , and then toasted it with a dram of gin.

The reader must now forget Chestnuts and Colts, and accom pany us further west. The fol owing days were marked by a num ber of great thunderstorms-or perhaps, thee was but one single storm which progressed across country in ponderous frogleaps and which we could not shake off just as we could not shake off detective Trapp: for it was during those days that the problem of the Aztec Red Convertible presented itself to me, and quite overshadowed the them e of Lo's lovers.

Queer! I who was jealous of every male we met-queer, how I misinterpreted the designations of doom . Perhaps I had been lul ed by Lo's m odest behavior in winter, and anyway it would have been too foolish even for a lunatic to suppose another Humbert was avidly fol owing Humbert and Humbert's nym phet with Jovian fireworks, over the great and ugly plains. I surmised, donc, that the Red Yak keeping behind us at a discreet distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom som e busybody had hired to see what exactly Humbert Humbert was doing with that minor stepdaughter of his. As happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance and crepitating lightnings, I had hal ucinations. M aybe they were more than hal ucinations. I do not know what she or he, or both had put into my liquor but one night I felt sure som ebody was tapping on the door of our cabin, and I flung it open, and noticed two things-that I was stark naked and that, white-glistening in the rain-dripping darkness, there stood a man holding before his face the mask of Jutting Chin, a grotesque sleuth in the funnies. He em itted a muffled guffaw and scurried away, and I reeled back into the room , and fel asleep again, and am not sure even to this day that the visit was not a drug-provoked dream : I have thoroughly studied Trapp's type of hum or, and this might have been a plausible sam ple. Oh, crude and absolutely ruthless! Som ebody, I imagined, was making m oney on those m asks of popular m onsters and morons. Did I see next morning two urchins rummaging in a garbage can and trying on Jutting Chin? I wonder. It may al have been a coincidencedue to atm ospheric conditions, I suppose. Being a murderer with a sensational but incom plete and unorthodox memory, I cannot Page 107

tel you, ladies and gentlem en, the exact day when I first knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was fol owing us. I do rem em ber, however, the first time I saw its driver quite clearly. I was proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of rain and kept seeing that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror, when presently the deluge dwindled to a patter, and then was suspended altogether. W ith a swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway, and needing a pair of new sunglasses, I pussled up at a fil ing station. W hat was happening was a sickness, a cancer, that could not be helped, so I simply ignored the fact that our quiet pursuer, in his converted state, stopped a little behind us at a cafe or bar bearing the idiotic sign: The Bustle: A Deceitful Seatful. Having seen to the needs of my car, I walked into the office to get those glasses and pay for the gas. As I was in the act of signing a traveler's check and wondered about my exact whereabouts, I happened to glance through a side window, and saw a terrible thing. A broad-backed man, baldish, in an oatm eal coat and dark-brown trousers, was listening to Lo who was leaning out of the car and talking to him very rapidly, her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and em phatic. W hat struck me with sickening force was-how should I put it?-the voluble fam iliarity of her way, as if they had known each other-oh, for weeks and weeks. I saw him scratch his cheek and nod, and turn, and walk back to his convertible, a broad and thickish man of my age, som ewhat resem bling Gustave Trapp, a cousin of my father's in Switzerland-sam e sm oothly tanned face, ful er than mine, with a sm al dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate m outh. Lolita was studying a road map when I got back into the car.

"W hat did that man ask you, Lol?"

"M an? Oh, that man. Oh yes. Oh, I don't know. He wondered if I had a map. Lost his way, I guess."

W e drove on, and I said:

"Now listen, Lo. I do not know whether you are lying or not, and I do not know whether you are insane or not, and I do not care for the moment; but that person has been fol owing us al day, and his car was at the motel yesterday, and I think he is a cop. You know perfectly wel what wil happen and where you wil go if the police find out about things. Now I want to know exactly what he said to you and what you told him." She laughed.

"If he's real y a cop," she said shril y but not il ogical y, "the worst thing we could do, would be to show him we are scared. Ignore him, Dad."

"Did he ask where we were going?"

"Oh, he knows that" (mocking me).

"Anyway," I said, giving up, "I have seen his face now. He is not pretty. He looks exactly like a relative of mine cal ed Trapp."

"Perhaps he is Trapp. If I were you-Oh, look, al the nines are changing into the next thousand. W hen I was a little kid," she continued unexpectedly, "I used to think they'd stop and go back to nines, if only my mother agreed to put the car in reverse." It was the first time, I think, she spoke spontaneously of her pre-Humbertian childhood; perhaps, the theatre had taught her that trick; and silently we traveled on, unpursued. but next day, like pain in a fatal disease that com es back as the drug and hope wear off, there it was again behind us, that glossy red beast. The traffic on the highway was light that day; nobody passed anybody; and nobody attem pted to get in between our hum ble blue car and its imperious red shadow-as if there were som e spel cast on that interspace, a zone of evil mirth and magic, a zone whose very precision and stability had a glass-like virtue that was almost artistic. The driver behind me, with his stuffed shoulders and Trappish mustache, looked like a display dummy, and his convertible seem ed to m ove only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with out shabby Page 108

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

vehicle. W e were many times weaker than his splendid, lacquered m achine, so that I did not even attem pt to outspeed him. O lente currite noctis equi! O softly run, nightmares!

W e climbed long grades and rol ed downhil again, and heeded speed limits, and spared slow children, and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yel ow shields, and no matter how and where we drove, the enchanted interspace slid on intact, mathem atical, mirage-like, the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet. And al the time I was aware of a private blaze on my right: her joyful eye, her flam ing cheek. A traffic policem an, deep in the nightmare of crisscross streets-at half-past-four p.m. in a factory town-was the hand of chance that interrupted the spel . He beckoned me on, and then with the sam e hand cut off my shadow. A score of cars were launched in between us, and I sped on, and deftly turned into a narrow lane. A sparrow alighted with a jum bo bread crum b, was tackled by another, and lost the crum b. W hen after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate m eandering, I returned to the highway, our shadow had disappeared.

Lola snorted and said: "If he is what you think he is, how sil y to give him the slip."

"I have other notions by now," I said.

"You should-ah-check them by-ah-keeping in touch with him, fahther deah," said Lo, writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm . "Gee, you are m ean," she added in her ordinary voice.

W e spent a grim night in a very foul cabin, under a sonorous am plitude of rain, and with a kind of prehistorical y loud thunder incessantly rol ing above us.

"I am not a lady and do not like lightning," said Lo, whose dread of electric storms gave me som e pathetic solace.

W e had breakfast in the township of Soda, pop. 1001.

"Judging by the terminal figure," I rem arked, "Fatface is already here."

"Your hum or," said Lo, "is sidesplitting, deah fahther." W e were in sage-brush country by that time, and there was a day or two of lovely release (I had been a fool, al was wel , that discom fort was merely a trapped flatus), and presently the m esas gave way to real m ountains, and, on time, we drove into W ace. Oh, disaster. Som e confusion had occurred, she had misread a date in the Tour Book, and the M agic Cave cerem onies were over! She took it bravely, I must adm it-and, when we discovered there was in jurortish W ace a summer theatre in ful swing, we natural y drifted toward it one fair midJune evening. I real y could not tel you the plot of the play we saw. A trivial affair, no doubt, with self-conscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady. The only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces, more or less im m obile, prettily painted, barelim bed-seven bem used pubescent girls in colored gauze that had been recruited local y (judging by the partisan flurry here and there am ong the audience) and were supposed to represent a living rainbow, which lingered throughout the last act, and rather teasingly faded behind a series of multiplied veils. I rem em ber thinking that this idea of children-colors had been lifted by authors Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom from a passage in Jam es Joyce, and that two of the colors were quite exasperatingly lovely-Orange who kept fidgeting al the time, and Em erald who, when her eyes got used to the pitch-black pit where we al heavily sat, suddenly sm iled at her mother or her protector.

As soon as the thing was over, and m anual applause-a sound my nerves cannot standbegan to crash al around me, I started to pul and push Lo toward the exit, in my so natural am orous impatience to get her back to our neon-blue cottage in the stunned, starry night: I always say nature is stunned by the sights she sees. Dol y-Lo, however, lagged behind, in a rosy daze, her pleased eyes narrowed, her sense of vision swam ping the rest of her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly cam e together at al in the m echanical action of clapping they stil went through. I had seen that kind of thing in Page 109

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

children before but, by God, this was a special child, m yopical y beam ing at the already rem ote stage where I glimpsed som ething of the joint authors-a man's tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawk-like, black-haired, strikingly tal woman.

"You've again hurt my wrist, you brute," said Lolita in a sm al voice as she slipped into her car seat.

"I am dreadful y sorry, my darling, my own ultraviolet darling," I said, unsuccessful y trying to catch her elbow, and I added, to change the conversation-to change the direction of fate, oh God, oh God: "Vivian is quite a woman. I am sure we saw her yesterday in that restaurant, in Soda pop."

"Som etimes," said Lo, "you are quite revoltingly dum b. First, Vivian is the male author, the gal author is Clare; and second, she is forty, married and has Negro blood."

"I thought," I said kidding her, "Quilty was an ancient flam e of yours, in the days when you loved me, in sweet old Ram sdale."

"W hat?" countered Lo, her features working. "that fat dentist? You must be confusing me with som e other fast little article."

And I thought to myself how those fast little articles forget everything, everything, while we, old lovers, treasure every inch of their nym phancy.

W ith Lo's knowledge and assent, the two post offices given to the Beardsley postmaster as forwarding addresses were P.O. W ace and P.O. Elphinstone. Next morning we visited the former and had to wait in a short but slow queue. Serene Lo studied the rogues'

gal ery. Handsom e Bryan Bryanski, alias Anthony Bryan, alias Tony Brown, eyes hazel, com plexion fair, was wanted for kidnapping. A sad-eyed old gentlem an's faux-pas was mail fraud, and, as if that were not enough, he was cursed with deformed arches. Sul en Sul ivan cam e with a caution: Is believed armed, and should be considered extrem ely dangerous. If you want to make a m ovie out of my book, have one of these faces gently melt into my own, while I look. And moreover there was a sm udgy snapshot of a M issing Girl, age fourteen, wearing brown shoes when last seen, rhym es. Please notify Sheriff Bul er.

I forget my letters; as to Dol y's, there was her report and a very special-looking envelope. This I deliberately opened and perused its contents. I concluded I was doing the foreseen since she did not seem to mind and drifted toward the newsstand near the exit.

"Dol y-Lo: W el , the play was a grand success. Al three hounds lay quiet having been slightly drugged by Cutler, I suspect, and Linda knew al your lines. She was fine, she had alertness and control, but lacked som ehow the responsiveness, the relaxed vitality, the charm of m y-and the author's-Diana; but there was no author to applaud us as last time, and the terrific electric storm outside interfered with our own m odest offstage thunder. Oh dear, life does fly. Now that everything is over, school, play, the Roy m ess, mother's confinem ent (our baby, alas, did not live!), it al seem s such a long time ago, though practical y I stil bear traces of the paint.

"W e are going to New York after tom orrow, and I guess I can't manage to wriggle out of accom panying my parents to Europe. I have even worse news for you. Dol y-Lo! I may not be back at Beardsley if and when you return. W ith one thing and another, one being you know who, and the other not being who you think you know, Dad wants me to go to school in Paris for one year while he and Ful bright are around.

"As expected, poor Poet stum bled in Scene I I when arriving at the bit of French nonsense. Remember? Ne m anque pas de dire Ã ton am ant, ChimÃ©ne, comme le lac est beau car il faut qu'il t'y mÃ©ne. Lucky beau! Qu'il t'y-W hat a tongue-twister! W el , be good, Lol ikins. Best love from your Poet, and best regards to the Governor. Your M

ona. P.S. Because of one thing and another, my correspondence happens to be rigidly control ed. So better wait til I write you from Europe." (She never did as far as I know. Page 110

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

The letter contained an elem ent of mysterious nastiness that I am too tired today to analyze. I found it later preserved in one of the Tour Books, and give it here Ã titre docum entaire. I read it twice.)

I looked up from the letter and was about to-There was no Lo to behold. W hile I was engrossed in M ona's witchery, Lo had shrugged her shoulders and vanished. "Did you happen to see-" I asked of a hunchback sweeping the floor near the entrance. He had, the old lecherer. He guessed she had seen a friend and had hurried out. I hurried out too. I stopped-she had not. I hurried on. I stopped again. It had happened at last. She had gone for ever.

In later years I have often wondered why she did not go forever that day. W as it the retentive quality of her new summer clothes in my locked car? W as it som e unripe particle in som e general plan? W as it simply because, al things considered, I might as wel be used to convey her to Elphinstone-the secret terminus, anyway? I only know I was quite certain she had left me for ever. The noncom m ittal m auve m ountains half encircling the town seem ed to me to swarm with panting, scram bling, laughing, panting Lolitas who dissolved in their haze. A big W made of white stones on a steep talus in the far vista of a cross street seem ed the very initial of woe.

The new and beautiful post office I had just em erged from stood between a dormant m ovie house and a conspiracy of poplars. The time was 9 a.m. m ountain time. The street was charming it into beauty, was one of those fragile young summer mornings with flashes of glass here and there and a general air of faltering and almost fainting at the prospect of an intolerably torrid noon. Crossing over, I loafed and leafed, as it were, through one long block: Drugs, Real Estate, Fashions, Auto Parts, Cafe, Sporting Goods, Real Estate, Furniture, Appliances, W estern Union, Cleaners, Grocery. Officer, officer, my daughter has run away. In col usion with a detective; in love with a blackmailer. Took advantage of my utter helplessness. I peered into al the stores. I deliberated inly if I should talk to any of the sparse foot-passengers. I did not. I sat for a while in the parked car. I inspected the public garden on the east side. I went back to Fashions and Auto Parts. I told myself with a burst of furious sarcasm - un ricanem ent-that I was crazy to suspect her, that she would turn up any minute.

She did.

I wheeled around and shook off the hand she had placed on my sleeve with a timid and im becile sm ile.

"Get into the car," I said.

She obeyed, and I went on pacing up and down, struggling with nam eless thoughts, trying to plan som e way of tackling her duplicity.

Presently she left the car and was at my side again. M y sense of hearing gradual y got tuned in to station Lo again, and I becam e aware she was tel ing me that she had met a former girl friend.

"Yes? W hom ?"

"A Beardsley girl."

"Good. I now every nam e in your group. Alice Adams?"

"The girl was not in my group."

"Good. I have a com plete student list with me. Her nam e please."

"She was not in my school She is just a town girl in Beardsley."

"Good. I have the Beardsley directory with me too. W e'l look up al the Browns."

"I only know her first nam e."

"M ary or Jane?"

"No-Dol y, like me."

"So that's the dead end" (the mirror you break your nose against). "Good. Let us try another angle. You have been absent twenty-eight minutes. W hat did the two Dol ys do?" Page 111

"W e went to a drugstore."

"And you had there-?"

"Oh, just a couple of Cokes."

"Careful, Dol y. W e can check that, you know."

"At least, she had. I had a glass of water."

"Good. W as it that place there?"

"Sure."

"Good, com e on, we'l gril the soda jerk."

"W ait a sec. Com e to think it might have been further down-just around the corner."

"Com e on al the sam e. Go in please. W el , let's see." (Opening a chained telephone book.) "Dignified Funeral Service. NO, not yet. Here we are: Druggists-Retail. Hil Drug Store. Larkin's Pharm acy. And two more. That's al W ace seem s to have in the way of soda fountains-at least in the business section. W el , we wil check them al ."

"Go to hel ," she said.

"Lo, rudeness wil get you nowhere."

"Okay," she said. "But you're not going to trap me. Okay, so we did not have a pop. W e just talked and looked at dresses in show windows."

"W hich? That window there for exam ple?"

"Yes, that one there, for exam ple."

"Oh Lo! Let's look closer at it."

It was indeed a pretty sight. A dapper young fel ow was vacuum -cleaning a carpet upon which stood two figures that looked as if som e blast had just worked havoc with them . One figure was stark naked, wigless and armless. Its com paratively sm al stature and sm irking pose suggested that when clothed it had represented, and would represent when clothed again, a girl-child of Lolita's size. But in its present state it was sexless. Next to it, stood a much tal er veiled bride, quite perfect and intacta except for the lack of one arm. On the floor, at the feet of these dam sels, where the man crawled about laboriously with his cleaner, there lay a cluster of three slender arms, and a blond wig. Two of the arms happened to be twisted and seem ed to suggest a clasping gesture of horror and supplication.

"Look, Lo," I said quietly. "Look wel . Is not that a rather good sym bol of som ething or other? However"-I went on as we got back into the car-"I have taken certain precautions. Here (delicately opening the glove com partment), on this pad I have our boy friend's car num ber."

As the ass I was I had not memorized it. W hat rem ained of it in my mind were the initial letter and the closing figure as if the whole am phitheater of six signs receded concavely behind a tinted glass too opaque to al ow the central series to be deciphered, but just translucent enough to make out its extrem e edges-a capital P and a 6. I have to go into those details (which in them selves can interest only a professional psychologue) because otherwise the reader (ah, if I could visualize him as a blond-bearded scholar with rosy lips sucking la pomme de sa canne as he quaffs my m anuscript!) might not understand the quality of the shock I experienced upon noticing that the P had acquired the bustle of a B and that the 6 had been deleted altogether. The rest, with erasures revealing the hurried shuttle sm ear of a pencil's rubber end, and with parts of num bers obliterated or reconstructed in a child's hand, presented a tangle of barbed wire to any logical interpretation. Al I knew was the state-one adjacent to the state Beardsley was in. I said nothing. I put the pad back, closed the com partment, and drove out of W ace. Lo had grabbed som e com ics from the back seat and, m obile-white-bloused, one brown elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of som e clout or clown. Three or four miles out of W ace, I turned into the shadow of a picnic ground where the morning had dum ped its litter of light on an em pty table; Lo looked up with a sem i-sm ile Page 112

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

of surprise and without a word I delivered a trem endous backhand cut that caught her sm ack on her hot hard little cheekbone.

And then the rem orse, the poignant sweetness of sobbing atonem ent, groveling love, the hopelessness of sensual reconciliation. In the velvet night, at M irana M otel (M

irana!) I kissed the yel owish soles of her long-toed feet, I immolated myself . . . But it was al of no avail. both doom ed were we. And soon I was to enter a new cycle of persecution. In a street of W ace, on its outskirts . . . Oh, I am quite sure it was not a delusion. In a street of W ace, I had glimpsed the Aztec Red Convertible, or its identical twin. Instead of Trapp, it contained four or five loud young people of several sexes-but I said nothing. After W ace a total y new situation arose. For a day or two, I enjoyed the mental em phasis with which I told myself that we were not, and never had been fol owed; and then I becam e sickeningly conscious that Trapp had changed his tactics and was stil with us, in this or that rented car.

A veritable Proteus of the highway, with bewildering ease he switched from one vehicle to another. This technique implied the existence of garages specializing in "stageautom obile" operations, but I never could discover the rem ises he used. He seem ed to patronize at first the Chevrolet genus, beginning with a Cam pus Cream convertible, then going on to a sm al Horizon Blue sedan, and thenceforth fading into Surf Gray and Driftwood Gray. Then he turned to other makes and passed through a pale dul rainbow of paint shades, and one day I found myself attem pting to cope with the subtle distinction between our own Dream Blue M elmoth and the Crest Blue Oldsm obile he had rented; grays, however, rem ained his favorite cryptochrom ism , and, in agonizing nightmares, I tried in vain to sort out properly such ghosts as Chrysler's Shel Gray, Chevrolet's Thistle Gray, Dodge's French Gray . . .

The necessity of being constantly on the lookout for his little mustache and open shirt-or for his baldish pate and broad shoulders-led me to a profound study of al cars on the road-behind, before, alongside, com ing, going, every vehicle under the dancing sun: the quiet vacationist's autom obile with the box of Tender-Touch tissues in the back window; the recklessly speeding jalopy ful of pale children with a shaggy dog's head protruding, and a crum pled m udguard; the bachelor's tudor sedan crowded with suits on hangers; the huge fat house trailer weaving in front, im m une to the Indian file of fury boiling behind it; the car with the young fem ale passenger politely perched in the middle of the front seat to be closer to the young male driver; the car carrying on its roof a red boat bottom up . . . The gray car slowing up before us, the gray car catching up with us. W e were in m ountain country, som ewhere between Snow and Cham pion, and rol ing down an almost imperceptible grade, when I had my next distinct view of Detective Param our Trapp. The gray mist behind us had deepened and concentrated into the com pactness of a Dominion Blue sedan. Al of a sudden, as if the car I drove responded to my poor heart's pangs, we were slithering from side to side, with som ething making a helpless plapplap-plap under us.

"You got a flat, mister," said cheerful Lo.

I pul ed up-near a precipice. She folded her arms and put her foot on the dashboard. I got out and exam ined the right rear wheel. The base of its tire was sheepishly and hideously square. Trapp had stopped som e fifty yards behind us. His distant face formed a grease spot of mirth. This was my chance. I started to walk towards him-with the bril iant idea of asking him for a jack through I had one. He backed a little. I stubbed my toe against a stone-and there was a sense of general laughter. Then a trem endous truck loom ed from behind Trapp and thundered by m e-and immediately after, I heard it utter a convulsive honk. Instinctively I looked back-and saw my own car gently creeping away. I could make out Lo ludicrously at the wheel, and the engine was certainly running-though I rem em bered I had cut it but had not applied the em ergency brake; and Page 113

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

during the brief space of throb-time that it took me to reach the croaking m achine which cam e to a standstil at last, it dawned upon me that during the last two years little Lo had had am ple time to pick up the rudiments of driving. As I wrenched the door open, I was goddam sure she had started the car to prevent me from walking up to Trapp. Her trick proved useless, however, for even while I was puruing her he had made an energetic Uturn and was gone. I rested for a while. Lo asked wasn't I going to thank her-the car had started to m ove by itself and-Getting no answer, she immersed herself in a study of the map. I got out again and com m enced the "ordeal of the orb," as Charlotte used to say. Perhaps, I was losing my mind.

W e continued our grotesque journey. After a forlorn and useless dip, we went up and up. On a steep grade I found myself behind the gigantic truck that had overtaken us. It was now groaning up a winding road and was im possible to pass. Out of its front part a sm al oblong of sm ooth silver-the inner wrapping of chewing gum - escaped and flew back into our windshield. It occurred to me that if I were real y losing my mind, I might end by murdering som ebody. In fact-said high-and-dry Humbert to floundering Humbert-it might be quite clever to prepare things-to transfer the weapon from box to pocket-so as to be ready to take advantage of the spel of insanity when it does com e. 20

By permitting Lolita to study acting I had, fond fool, suffered her to cultivate deceit. It now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in "Hedda Gabler," or where are the climaxes in

"Love Under the Lindens," or analyze the prevailing m ood of "Cherry Orchard"; it was real y a matter of learning to betray me. How I deplored now the exercises in sensual simulation that I had so often seen her go through in our Beardsley parlor when I would observe her from som e strategic point while she, like a hypnotic subject of a performer in a mystic rite, produced sophisticated version of infantile make-believe by going through the mimetic actions of hearing a moan in the dark, seeing for the first time a brand new young stepm other, tasting som ething she hated, such as buttermilk, sm el ing crushed grass in a lush orchard, or touching mirages of objects with her sly, slender, girl-child hands. Am ong my papers I stil have a mimeographed sheet suggesting: Tactile dril . Imagine Yourself picking up and holding: a pingpong bal , an apple, a sticky date, a new flannel-fluffed tennis bal , a hot potato, an ice cube, a kitten, a puppy, a horseshoe, a feather, a flashlight.

Knead with your fingers the fol owing imaginary things: a piece of brad, india rubber, a friend's aching tem ple, a sam ple of velvet, a rose petal.

You are a blind girl. Palpate the face of: a Greek youth, Cyrano, Santa Claus, a baby, a laughing faun, a sleeping stranger, your father.

But she had been so pretty in the weaving of those delicate spel s, in the dream y perform ance of her enchantments and duties! On certain adventurous evenings, in Beardsley, I also had her dance for me with the prom ise of som e treat or gift, and although these routine leg-parted leaps of hers were more like those of a footbal cheerleader than like the languorous and jerky motions of a Parisian petit rat, the rhythm s of her not quite nubile limbs had given me pleasure. But al that was nothing, absolutely nothing, to the indescribable itch of rapture that her tennis gam e produced in me-the teasing delirious feeling of teetering on the very brink of unearthly order and splendor. Despite her advanced age, she was more of a nym phet than ever, with her apricotcolored limbs, in her sub-teen tennis togs! W inged gentlem en! No hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then, in that Colorado resort between Snow and Elphinstone, with everything right: the white wide little-boy shorts, the slender waist, the apricot midriff, the white breast-kerchief whose ribbons went up and encircled her neck to end behind in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable apricot Page 114

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

shoulder blades with that pubescence and those lovely gentle bones, and the sm ooth, downward-tapering back. Her cap had a white peak. Her racket had cost me a sm al fortune. Idiot, triple idiot! I could have filmed her! I would have had her now with me, before my eyes, in the projection room of my pain and despair!

She would wait and relax for a bar or two of white-lined time before going into the act of serving, and often bounced the bal once or twice, or pawed the ground a little, always at ease, always rather vague about the score, always cheerful as she so seldom was in the dark life she led at hom e. Her tennis was the highest point to which I can imagine a young creature bringing the art of make-believe, although I dareseay, for her it was the very geom etry of basic reality.

The exquisite clarity of al her m ovem ents had its auditory counterpart in the pure ringing sound of her every stroke. The bal when it entered her aura of control becam e som ehow whiter, its resilience som ehow richer, and the instrum ent of precision she used upon it seem ed inordinately prehensile and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact. Her form was, indeed, an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely top-notch tenniswithout any utilitarian results. As Edusa's sister, Electra Gold, a marvelous young coach, said to me once while I sat on a pulsating hard bench watching Dolores Haze toying with Linda Hal (and being beaten by her): "Dol y has a magnet in the center of her racket guts, but why the heck is she so polite?" Ah, Electra, what did it matter, with such grace! I rem em ber at the very first gam e I watched being drenched with an almost painful convulsion of beauty assimilation. M y Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the am ple and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot, pristine armpit, burnished arm and far back-flung racket, as she sm iled up with gleam ing teeth at the sm al globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosm os she had created for the express purpose of fal ing upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip. It had, that serve of hers, beauty, directness, youth, a classical purity of trajectory, and was, despite its spanking pace, fairly easy to return, having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop.

That I could have had al her strokes, al her enchantments, immortalized in segm ents of cel uloid, makes me moan today with frustration. They would have been so much more than the snapshots I burned! Her overhead vol ey was related to her service as the envoy is to the bal ade; for she had been trained, my pet, to patter up at once to the net on her nimble, vivid, white-shod feet. There was nothing to choose between her forehand and backhand drives: they were mirror images of one another-my very loins stil tingle with those pistol reports repeated by crisp echoes and Electra's cries. One of the pearls of Dol y's gam e was a short half-vol ey that Ned Litam had taught her in California. She preferred acting to swimming, and swimming to tennis; yet I insist that had not som ething within her been broken by m e-not that I realized it then!-she would have had on the top of her perfect form the wil to win, and would have becom e a real girl cham pion. Dolores, with two rackets under her arm, in W imbledon. Dolores endorsing a Drom edary. Dolores turning professional. Dolores acting a girl cham pion in a m ovie. Dolores and her gray, hum ble, hushed husband-coach, old Humbert. There was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her gam e-unless one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcom e as the feint of a nym phet. She who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life, revealed an innocence, a frankness, a kindness of bal placing, that permitted a second-rate but determined player, no matter how uncouth and incom petent, to poke and cut his way to victory. Despite her sm al stature, she covered the one thousand and fifty-three square feet of her half of the court with wonderful ease, once she had entered into the rhythm of a ral y and as long as she could direct that rhythm ; but any abrupt attack, or sudden change of tactics on her adversary's part, left her Page 115

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

helpless. At match point, her second serve, which-rather typical y-was even stronger and more stylish than her first (for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners have), would strike vibrantly the hard-cord of the net-and ricochet out of court. The polished gem of her dropshot was snapped up and put away by an opponent who seem ed four-legged and wielded a crooked paddle. Her dram atic drives and lovely vol eys would candidly fal at his feet. Over and over again she would land an easy one into the net-and merrily mimic dism ay by drooping in a bal et attitude, with her forelocks hanging. So sterile were her grace and whipper that she could not even win from panting me and my oldfashioned lifting drive. I suppose I am especial y susceptible to the magic of gam es. In my chess sessions with Gaston I saw the board as a square pool of limpid water with rare shel s and stratagem s rosily visible upon the sm ooth tessel ated bottom , which to my confused adversary was al ooze and squid-cloud. Similarly, the initial tennis coaching I had inflicted on Lolita-prior to the revelations that cam e to her through the great Californian's lessons-rem ained in my mind as oppressive and distressful memories-not only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by every suggestion of mine-but because the precious symmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harm onies latent in her was utterly jum bled by the clum siness and lassitude of the resentful child I mistaught. Now things were different, and on that particular day, in the pure air of Cham pion, Colorado, on that adm irable court at the foot of seep stone stairs leading up to Cham pion Hotel where we had spent the night, I felt I could rest from the nightmare of unknown betrayals within the innocence of her style, of her soul, of her essential grace. She was hitting hard and flat, with her usual effortless sweep, feeding me deep skimming bal s-al so rhythm ical y coordinated and overt as to reduce my footwork to, practical y, a swinging strol -crack players wil understand what I m ean. M y rather heavily cut serve that I had been taught by my father who had learned it from Decugis or Borman, old friends of his and great cham pions, would have seriously troubled my Lo, had I real y tried to trouble her. But who would upset such a lucid dear? Did I ever mention that her bare arm bore the 8 of vaccination? That I loved her hopelessly? That she was only fourteen?

An inquisitive butterfly passed, dipping, between us.

Two people in tennis shorts, a red-haired fel ow only about eight years my junior, and an indolent dark girl with a m oody m outh and hard eyes, about two years Lolita's senior, appeared from nowhere. As is com m on with dutiful tyros, their rackets were sheathed and fram ed, and they carried them not as if they were the natural and com fortable extensions of certain specialized muscles, but hammers or blunderbusses or whimbles, or my own dreadful cum bersom e sins. Rather uncerem oniously seating them selves near my precious coat, on a bench adjacent to the court, they fel to adm iring very vocal y a ral y of som e fifty exchanges that Lo innocently helped me to foster and uphold-until there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as her overhead sm ash went out of court, whereupon she melted into winsom e merriment, my golden pet. I felt thirsty by then, and walked to the drinking fountain; there Red approached me and in al hum ility suggested a mixed double. "I am Bil M ead," he said. "And that's Fay Page, actress. M affy On Say"-he added (pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished Fay who was already talking to Dol y). I was about to reply "Sorry, but-" (for I hate to have my fil y involved in the chops and jabs of cheap bunglers), when a rem arkably melodious cry diverted my attention: a bel boy was tripping down the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs. I was wanted, if you please, on an urgent long distance cal -so urgent in fact that the line was being held for me. Certainly. I got into my coat (inside pocket heavy with pistol) and told Lo I would be back in a minute. She was picking up a bal -in the continental foot-racket way which was one of Page 116

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

the few nice things I had taught her,-and sm iled-she sm iled at me!

An awful calm kept my heart afloat as I fol owed the boy up to the hotel. This, to use an American term, in which discovery, retribution, torture, death, eternity appear in the shape of a singularly repulsive nutshel , was it. I had left her in mediocre hands, but it hardly mattered now. I would fight, of course. Oh, I would fight. Better destroy everything than surrender her. Yes, quite a climb.

At the desk, dignified, Rom an-nosed man, with, I suggest, a very obscure past that might reward investigation, handed me a m essage in his own hand. The line had not been held after al . The note said:

"M r. Humbert. The head of Birdsley (sic!) School cal ed. Summer residence-Birdsley 28282. Please cal back immediately. Highly im portant." I folded myself into a booth, took a little pil , and four about twenty minutes tussled with space-spooks. A quartet of propositions gradual y becam e audible: soprano, there was no such num ber in Beardsley; alto, M iss Pratt was on her way to England; tenor, Beardsley School had not telephoned; bass, they could not have done so, since nobody knew I was, that particular day, in Cham pion, Colo. Upon my stinging him, the Rom an took the trouble to find out if there had been a long distance cal . There had been none. A fake cal from som e local dial was not excluded. I thanked him. He said: You bet. After a visit to the purling men's room and a stiff drink at the bar, I started on my return march. From the very first terrace I saw, far below, on the tennis court which seem ed the size of a school child's il -wiped slate, golden Lolita playing in a double. She m oved like a fair angel am ong three horrible Boschian cripples. One of these, her partner, while changing sides, jocosely slapped her on her behind with his racket. He had a rem arkably round head and wore incongruous brown trousers. There was a momentary flurry-he saw me, and throwing away his racket-mine-scuttled up the slope. He waved his wrists and elbows in a wouldbe com ical imitation of rudimentary wings, as he climbed, blow-legged, to the street, where his gray car awaited him. Next moment he and the grayness were gone. W hen I cam e down, the rem aining trio were col ecting and sorting out the bal s.

"M r. M ead, who was that person?"

Bil and Fay, both looking very solem n, shook their heads.

That absurd intruder had butted in to make up a double, hadn't he, Dol y?

Dol y. The handle of my racket was stil disgustingly warm. Before returning to the hotel, I ushered her into a little al ey half-sm othered in fragrant shrubs, with flowers like sm oke, and was about to burst into ripe sobs and plead with her imperturbed dream in the most abject m anner for clarification, no matter how meretricious, of the slow awfulness enveloping me, when we found ourselves behind the convulsed M ead twosomeassorted people, you know, m eeting am ong idyl ic settings in old com edies. Bil and Fay were both weak with laughter-we had com e at the end of their private joke. It did not real y matter.

Speaking as if it real y did not real y matter, and assum ing, apparently, that life was autom atical y rol ing on with al its routine pleasures, Lolita said she would like to change into her bathing things, and spend the rest of the afternoon at the swimming pool. It was a gorgeous day. Lolita!

21

"Lo! Lola! Lolita!" I hear myself crying from a doorway into the sun, with the acoustics of time, dom ed time, endowing my cal and its tel -tale hoarseness with such a wealth of anxiety, passion and pain that real y it would have been instrum ental in wrenching open the zipper of her nylon shroud had she been dead. Lolita! In the middle of a trim turfed terrace I found her at last-she had run out before I was ready. Oh Lolita! There she was playing with a dam ned dog, not me. The animal, a terrier of sorts, was losing and snapping up again and adjusting between his jaws a wet little red bal ; he took rapid Page 117

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

chords with his front paws on the resilient turf, and then would bounce away. I had only wanted to see where she was, I could not swim with my heart in that state, but who caredand there she was, and there was I, in my robe-and so I stopped cal ing; but suddenly som ething in the pattern of her motions, as she dashed this way and that in her Aztec Red bathing briefs and bra, struck me . . . there was an ecstasy, a m adness about her frolics that was too much of a glad thing. Even the dog seem ed puzzled by the extravagance of her reactions. I put a gentle hand to my chest as I surveyed the situation. The turquoise blue swimming pool som e distance behind the lawn was no longer behind that lawn, but within my thorax, and my organs swam in it like excrem ents in the blue sea water in Nice. One of the bathers had left the pool and, half-concealed by the peacocked shade of trees, stood quite stil , holding the ends of the towel around his neck and fol owing Lolita with his am ber eyes. There he stood, in the cam ouflage of sun and shade, disfigured by them and masked by his own nakedness, his dam p black hair or what was left of it, glued to his round head, his little mustache a hum id sm ear, the wool on his chest spread like a symmetrical trophy, his naval pulsating, his hirsute thighs dripping with bright droplets, his tight wet black bathing trunks bloated and bursting with vigor where his great fat bul ybag was pul ed up and back like a padded shield over his reversed beasthood. And as I looked at his oval nut-brown face, it dawned upon me that what I had recognized him by was the reflection of my daughter's countenance-the sam e beatitude and grim ace but made hideous by his maleness. And I also knew that the child, my child, knew he was looking, enjoyed the lechery of his look and was putting on a show of gam bol and glee, the vile and beloved slut. As she made for the bal and missed it, she fel on her back, with her obscene young legs madly pedaling in the air; I could sense the musk of her excitem ent from where I stood, and then I saw (petrified with a kind of sacred disgust) the man close his eyes and bare his sm al , horribly sm al and even, teeth as he leaned against a tree in which a multitude of dappled Priaps shivered. Immediately afterwards a marvelous transformation took place. He was no longer the satyr but a very good-natured and foolish Swiss cousin, the Gustave Trapp I have mentioned more than once, who used to counteract his "sprees" (he drank beer with milk, the good swine) by feats of weight-lifting-tottering and grunting on a lake beach with his otherwise very com plete bathing suit jauntily stripped from one shoulder. This Trapp noticed me from afar and working the towel on his nam e walked back with false insouciance to the pool. And as if the sun had gone out of the gam e, Lo slackened and slowly got up ignoring the bal that the terrier placed before her. W ho can say what heartbreaks are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a rom p? I started to say som ething, and then sat down on the grass with a quite m onstrous pain in my chest and vom ited a torrent of browns and greens that I had never rem em bered eating. I saw Lolita's eyes, and they seem ed to be more calculating than frightened. I heard her saying to a kind lady that her father was having a fit. Then for a long time I lay in a lounge chair swal owing pony upon pony of gin. And next morning I felt strong enough to drive on (which in later years no doctor believed).

22

The two-room cabin we had ordered at Silver Spur Court, Elphinstone, turned out to belong to the glossily browned pine-log kind that Lolita used to be so fond of in the days of our carefree first journey; oh, how different things were now! I am not referring to Trapp or Trapps. After al -wel , real y . . . After al , gentlem en, it was becom ing abundantly clear that al those identical detectives in prism atical y changing cars were figm ents of my persecution mania, recurrent images based on coincidence and chance resem blance. Soyons logiques, crowed the cocky Gal ic part of my brain-and proceeded to rout the notion of a Lolita-m addened salesm an or com edy gangster, with stooges, persecuting me, and hoaxing me, and otherwise taking riotous advantage of my strange Page 118

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

relations with the law. I rem em ber humming my panic away. I rem em ber evolving even an explanation of the "Birdsley" telephone cal . . . But if I could dism iss Trapp, as I had dism issed my convulsions on the lawn at Cham pion, I could do nothing with the anguish of knowing Lolita to be so tantalizingly, so miserably unattainable and beloved on the very even of a new era, when my alem bics told me she should stop being a nym phet, stop torturing me.

An additional, abom inable, and perfectly gratuitous worry was lovingly prepared for me in Elphinstone. Lo had been dul and silent during the last lap-two hundred m ountainous miles uncontam inated by sm oke-gray sleuths or zigzagging zanies. She hardly glanced at the fam ous, oddly shaped, splendidly flushed rock which jutted above the m ountains and had been the take-off for nirvana on the part of a tem peram ental show girl. The town was newly built, or rebuilt, on the flat floor of a seven-thousand-foot-high val ey; it would soon bore Lo, I hoped, and we would spin on to California, to the M exican border, to mythical bays, saguaro desserts, fatam organas. JosÃ© Lizzarrabengoa, as you rem em ber, planned to take his Carmen to the Etats Unis. I conjured up a Central American tennis com petition in which Dolores Haze and various Californian schoolgirl cham pions would dazzlingly participate. Good-wil tours on that sm iling level eliminate the distinction between passport and sport. W hy did I hope we would be happy abroad? A change of environm ent is the traditional fal acy upon which doom ed loves, and lungs, rely. M rs. Hays, the brisk, briskly rouged, blue-eyed widow who ran the motor court, asked me if I were Swiss perchance, because her sister had married a Swiss ski instructor. I was, whereas my daughter happened to be half Irish. I registered, Hays gave me the key and a tinkling sm ile, and, stil twinkling, showed me where to park the car; Lo crawled out and shivered a little: the lum inous evening air was decidedly crisp. Upon entering the cabin, she sat down on a chair at a card table, buried her face in the crook of her arm and said she felt awful. Shamming, I thought, shamming, no doubt, to evade my caresses; I was passionately parched; but she began to whimper in an unusual y dreary way when I attem pted to fondle her. Lolita il . Lolita dying. Her skin was scalding hot! I took her tem perature, oral y, then looked up a scribbled formula I fortunately had in a jotter and after laboriously reducing the, m eaningless to me, degrees Fahrenheit to the intimate centigrade of my childhood, found she had 40.4, which at least made sense. Hysterical little nym phs might, I knew, run up al kinds of tem perature-even exceeding a fatal count. And I would have given her a sip of hot spiced wine, and two aspirins, and kissed the fever away, if, upon an exam ination of her lovely uvula, one of the gem s of her body, I had not seen that it was a burning red. I undressed her. Her breath was bittersweet. Her brown rose tasted of blood. She was shaking from head to toe. She com plained of a painful stiffness in the upper vertebrae-and I thought of poliom yelitis as any American parent would. Giving up al hope of intercourse, I wrapped her in a laprobe and carried her into the car. Kind M rs. Hays in the m eantime had alerted the local doctor. "You are lucky it happened here," she said; for not only was Blue the best man in the district, but the Elphinstone hospital was as m odern as m odern could be, despite its limited capacity. W ith a heterosexual ErlkÃ¶nig in pursuit, thither I drove, half-blinded by a royal sunset on the lowland side and guided by a little old woman, a portable witch, perhaps his daughter, whom M rs. Haus had lent me, and whom I was never to see again. Dr. Blue, whose learning, no doubt, was infinitely inferior to his reputation, assured me it was a virus infection, and when I al uded to her com paratively recent flu, curtly said this was another bug, he had forty such cases on his hands; al of which sounded like the

"ague" of the ancients. I wondered if I should mention, with a casual chuckle, that my fifteen-year-old daughter had had a minor accident while climbing an awkward fence with her boy friend, but knowing I was drunk, I decided to withhold the information til later if necessary. To Page 119

an unsm iling blond bitch of a secretary I gave my daughter's age as "practical y sixteen." W hile I was not looking, my child was taken away from me! In vain I insisted I be al owed to spend the night on a "welcom e" mat in a corner of their dam ned hospital. I ran up constructivistic flights of stairs, I tried to trace my darling so as to tel her she had better not babble, especial y if she felt as lightheaded as we al did. At one point, I was rather dreadful y rude to a very young and very cheeky nurse with overdeveloped gluteal parts and blazing black eyes-of Basque descent, as I learned. Her father was an im ported shepherd, a trainer of sheep dogs. Final y, I returned to the car and rem ained in it for I do not know how many hours, hunched up in the dark, stunned by my new solitude, looking out open-m outhed now at the dimly il um ined, very square and low hospital building squatting in the middle of its lawny block, now up at the wash of stars and the jagged silvery ram parts of the haute m ontagne where at the moment M ary's father, lonely Joseph Lore was dream ing of Oloron, Lagore, Rolas-que sais-je!-or seducing a ewe. Such-like fragrant vagabond thoughts have been always a solace to me in times of unusual stress, and only when, despite liberal libations, I felt fairly num bed by the endless night, did I think of driving back to the motel. The old woman had disappeared, and I was not quite sure of my way. W ide gravel roads criss-crossed drowsy rectangual shadows. I made out what looked like the silhouette of gal ows on what was probably a school playground; and in another wastelike black there rose in dom ed silence the pale tem ple of som e local sect. I found the highway at last, and then the motel, where mil ions of so-cal ed "m il ers," a kind of insect, were swarming around the neon contours of "No Vacancy"; and, when, at 3 a.m., after one of those untimely hot showers which like som e mordant only help to fix a man's despair and weariness, I lay on her bed that sm el ed of chestnuts and roses, and peppermint, and the very delicate, very special French perfum e I latterly al owed her to use, I found myself unable to assimilate the simple fact that for the first time in two years I was separated from my Lolita. Al at once it occurred to me that her il ness was som ehow the developm ent of a them e-that it had the sam e taste and tone as the series of linked impressions which had puzzled and tormented me during our journey; I imagined that secret agent, or secret lover, or prankster, or hal ucination, or whatever he was, prowling around the hospital-and Aurora had hardly

"warmed her hands," as the pickers of lavender way in the country of my birth, when I found myself trying to get into that dungeon again, knocking upon its green doors, breakfastless, stool-less, in despair.

This was Tuesday, and W ednesday or Thursday, splendidly reacting like the darling she was to som e "serum " (sparrow's sperm or dugong's dung), she was much better, and the doctor said that in a couple of days she would be "skipping" again. Of the eight times I visited her, the last one alone rem ains sharply engraved on my mind. It had been a great feat to com e for I felt al hol owed out by the infection that by then was at work on me too. None wil know the strain it was to carry that bouquet, that load of love, those books that I had traveled sixty miles to buy: Browning's Dram atic W orks, The history of Dancing, Clowns and Colum bines, The Russian Bal et, Flowers of the Rockies, the Theatre Guild Anthology, Tennis by Helen W il s, who had won the National Junior Girl Singles at the age of fifteen. As I was staggering up to the door of my daughter's thirteendol ar-a day private room , M ary Lore, the beastly young part-time nurse who had taken an unconcealed dislike to me, em erged with a finished breakfast tray, placed it with a quick crash on a chair in the corridor, and, fundam ent jigging, shot back into the room probably to warn her poor little Dolores that the tyrannical old father was creeping up on crepe soles, with books and bouquet: the latter I had com posed of wild flowers and beautiful leaves gathered with my own gloved hands on a m ountain pass at sunrise (I hardly slept at al that fateful week).

Feeding my Carmencita wel ? Idly I glanced at the tray. On a yolk-stained plate there was Page 120

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

a crum pled envelope. It had contained som ething, since one edge was torn, but there was no address on it-nothing at al , save a phony armorial design with "Ponderosa Lodge" in green letters; thereupon I performed a chassÃ©-croisÃ© with M ary, who was in the act of bustling out again-wonderful how fast they m ove and how little they do, those rum py young nurses. She glowered at the envelope I had put back, uncrum pled.

"You better not touch," she said, nodding directional y. "Could burn your fingers." Below my dignity to rejoin. Al I said was:

"Je croyais que c'Ã¨tait un bil -not a bil et doux." Then, entering the sunny room , to Lolita:

"Bonjour, m on petit."

"Dolores," said M ary Lore, entering with me, past me, though me, the plum p whore, and blinking, and starting to fold very rapidly a white flannel blanket as she blinked:

"Dolores, your pappy thinks you are getting letters from my boy friend. It's me (sm ugly tapping herself on the sm al glit cross she wore) gets them . And my pappy can parlayvoo as wel as yours." She left the room . Dolores, so rosy and russet, lips freshly painted, hair bril iantly brushed, bare arms straightened out on neat coverleat, lay innocently beam ing at me or nothing. On the bed table, next to a paper napkin and a pencil, her topaz ring burned in the sun.

"what gruesom e funeral flowers," she said. "Thanks al the sam e. But do you mind very much cutting out the French? It annoys everybody."

Back at the usual rush cam e the ripe young hussy, reeking of urine and garlic, with the Desert News, which her fair patient eagerly accepted, ignoring the sum ptuously il ustrated volum es I had brought.

"M y sister Ann," said M arry (topping information with afterthought), "works at the Ponderosa place."

Poor Bluebeard. Those brutal brothers. Est-ce que tu ne m'aimes plus, ma Carmen?

She never had. At the moment I knew my love was as hopeless as ever-and I also knew the two girls were conspirators, plotting in Basque, or Zem firian, against my hopeless love. I shal go further and say that Lo was playing a double gam e since she was also fooling sentimental M ary whom she had told, I suppose, that she wanted to dwel with her funloving young uncle and not with cruel melancholy me. And another nurse whom I never identified, and the vil age idiot who carted cots and coffins into the elevator, and the idiotic green love birds in a cage in the waiting room - al were in the plot, the sordid plot. I suppose M ary thought com edy father Professor Humbertoldi was interfering with the rom ance between Dolores and her father-substitute, roly-poly Rom eo (for you were rather lardy, you know, Rom , despite al that "snow" and "joy juice"). M y throat hurt. I stood, swal owing, at the window and stared at the m ountains, at the rom antic rock high up in the sm iling plotting sky.

"M y Carmen," I said (I used to cal her that som etimes), "we shal leave this raw sore town as soon as you get out of bed."

"Incidental y, I want al my clothes," said the gitanil a, hum ping up her knees and turning to another page.

". . . Because, real y," I continued, "there is no point in staying here."

"There is no point in staying anywhere," said Lolita. I lowered myself into a cretonne chair and, opening the attractive botanical work, attem pted, in the fever-humming hush of the room , to identify my flowers. This proved im possible. Presently a musical bel softly sounded som ewhere in the passage. I do not think they had more than a dozen patients (three or four were lunatics, as Lo had cheerful y informed me earlier) in that show place of a hospital, and the staff had too much leisure. However-likewise for reasons of showregulations were rigid. It is also true that I kept com ing at the wrong hours. Not without a secret flow of dream y malice, Page 121

visionary M ary (next time it wil be une bel e dam e toute en bleu floating through Roaring Gulch) plucked me by the sleeve to lead me out. I looked at her hand; it dropped. As I was leaving, leaving voluntarily, Dolores Haze rem inded me to bring her next morning . .

. She did not rem em ber where the various things she wanted were . . . "Bring me," she cried (out of sight already, door on the m ove, closing, closed), "the new gray suitcase and M other's trunk"; but by next morning I was shivering, and boozing, and dying nit he motel bed she had used for just a few minutes, and the best I could do under the circular and dilating circum stances was to send the two bags over with the widow's beau, a robust and kindly trucker. I imagined Lo displaying her treasures to M ary . . . No doubt, I was a little delirious-and on the fol owing day I was stil a vibration rather than a solid, for when I looked out the bathroom window at the adjacent lawn, I saw Dol y's beautiful young bicycle propped up there on its support, the graceful front wheel looking away from me, as it always did, and a sparrow perched on the saddle-but it was the landlady's bike, and sm iling a little, and shaking my poor head over my fond fancies, I tottered back to my bed, and lay as quiet as a saint-Saint, forsooth! W hile brown Dolores, On a patch of sunny green

W ith Sanchicha reading stories

In a m ovie magazine--which was represented by num erous specimens wherever Dolores landed, and there was som e great national celebration in town judging by the firecrackers, veritable bom bs, that exploded al the time, and at five minutes to two p.m. I heard the sound of whistling lips nearing the half-opened door of my cabin, and then a thum p upon it. It was big Frank. He rem ained fram ed in the opened door, one hand on its jam b, leaning forward a little.

Howdy. Nurse Lore was on the telephone. She wanted to know was I better and would I com e today?

At twenty paces Frank used to look a m ountain of health; at five, as now, he was a ruddy mosaic of scars-had been blown through a wal overseas; but despite nam eless injuries he was able to man a trem endous truck, fish, hunt, drink, and buoyantly dal y with roadside ladies. That day, either because it was such a great holiday, or simply because he wanted to divert a sick man, he had taken off the glove he usual y wore on his left hand (the one pressing against the side of the door) and revealed to the fascinated sufferer not only an entire lack of fourth and fifth fingers, but also a naked girl, with cinnabar nipples and indigo delta, charmingly tattooed on the back of his crippled hand, its index and middle digit making her legs while his wrist bore her flower-crowned head. Oh, delicious

. . . reclining against the woodwork, like som e sly fairy.

I asked him to tel M ary Lore I would stay in bed al day and would get into touch with my daughter som etime tom orrow if I felt probably Polynesian. He noticed the direction of my gaze and made her right hip twitch am orously.

"Okey-dokey," big Frank sang out, slapped the jam b, and whistling, carried my m essage away, and I went on drinking, and by morning the fever was gone, and although I was as limp as a toad, I put on the purple dressing gown over my maize yel ow pajam as, and walked over to the office telephone. Everything was fine. A bright voice informed me that yes, everything was fine, my daughter had checked out the day before, around two, her uncle, M r. Gustave, had cal ed for her with a cocker spaniel pup and a sm ile for everyone, and a black Caddy Lack, and had paid Dol y's bil in cash, and told them to tel me I should not worry, and keep warm, they were at Grandpa's ranch as agreed. Elphinstone was, and I hope stil is, a very cute little town. It was spread like a m aquette, you know, with its neat greenwool trees and red-roofed houses over the val ey floor and I think I have al uded earlier to its m odel school and tem ple and spacious rectangular Page 122

blocks, som e of which were, curiously enough, just unconventional pastures with a mule or a unicorn grazing in the young July morning mist. Very am using: at one gravelgroaning sharp turn I sideswiped a parked car but said to myself telestical y-and, telepathical y (I hoped), to its gesticulating owner-that I would return later, address Bird School, Bird, New Bird, the gin kept my heart alive but bem azed my brain, and after som e lapses and losses com m on to dream sequences, I found myself in the reception room

, trying to beat up the doctor, and roaring at people under chairs, and clam oring for M

ary who luckily for her was not there; rough hands plucked at my dressing gown, ripping off a pocket, and som ehow I seem to have been sitting on a bald brown-headed patient, whom I had mistaken for Dr. Blue, and who eventual y stood up, rem arking with a preposterous accent: "Now, who is nevrotic, I ask?"-and then a gaunt unsm iling nurse presented me with seven beautiful, beautiful books and the exquisitely folded tartan lap robe, and dem anded a receipt; and in the sudden silence I becam e aware of a policem an in the hal way, to whom my fel ow motorist was pointing me out, and m eekly I signed the very sym bolic receipt, thus surrendering my Lolita to al those apes. But what else could I do? One simple and stark thought stood out and this was: "Freedom for the moment is everything." One false m ove-and I might have been made to explain a life of crime. So I simulated a com ing out of a daze. To my fel ow motorist I paid what he thought was fair. To Dr. Blue, who by then was stroking my hand, I spoke in tears of the liquor I bolstered too freely a tricky but not necessarily diseased heart with. To the hospital in general I apologized with a flourish that almost bowled me over, adding however that I was not on particularly good terms with the rest of the Humbert clan. To myself I whispered that I stil had my gun, and was stil a free man-free to trace the fugitive, free to destroy my brother.

A thousand-mile stretch of silk-sm ooth road separated Kasbeam , where, to the best of my belief, the red fiend had been scheduled to appear for the first time, and fateful Elphinstone which we had reached about a week before Independence Day. The journey had taken up most of June for we had seldom made more than a hundred and fifty miles per traveling day, spending the rest of the time, up to five days in one case, at various stopping places, al of them also prearranged, no doubt. It was that stretch, then, along which the fiend's spoor should be sought; and to this I devoted myself, after several unm entionable days of dashing up and down the relentlessly radiating roads in the vicinity of Elphinstone.

Imagine me, reader , with my shyness, my distaste for any ostentation, my inherent sense of the comme il faut, imagine me masking the frenzy of my grief with a trem bling ingratiating sm ile while devising som e casual pretext to flip through the hotel register:

"Oh," I would say, "I am almost positive that I stayed here once-let me look up the entries for mid-June-no, I see I'm wrong after al -what a very quaint nam e for a hom e town, Kawtagain. Thanks very much." Or: "I had a custom er staying here-I mislaid his addressm ay I . . .?" And every once in a while, especial y if the operator of the place happened to be a certain type of gloom y male, personal inspection of the books was denied me. I have a memo here: between July 5 and Novem ber 18, when I returned to Beardsley for a few days, I registered, if not actual y stayed, at 342 hotels, motels and tourist hom es. This figure includes a few registrations between Chestnut and Beardsley, one of which yielded a shadow of the fiend ("N. Petit, Larousse, Il ."); I had to space and time my inquiries careful y so as not to attract undue attention; and there must have been at least fifty places where I merely inquired at the desk-but that was a futile quest, and I preferred building up a foundation of verisimilitude and good wil by first paying for an unneeded room . M y survey showed that of the 300 or so books inspected, at least 20

Page 123

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

provided me with a clue: the loitering fiend had stopped even more often than we, or else-he was quite capable of that-he had thrown in additional registrations in order to keep me wel furnished with derisive hints. Only in one case had he actual y stayed at the sam e motor court as we, a few paces from Lolita's pil ow. In som e instances he had taken up quarters in the sam e or in a neighboring block; not infrequently he had lain in wait at an intermediate spot between two bespoken points. How vividly I recal ed Lolita, just before our departure from Beardsley, prone on the parlor rug, studying tour books and maps, and marking laps and stops with her lipstick!

I discovered at once that he had foreseen my investigations and had planted insulting pseudonym s for my special benefit. At the very first motel office I visited, Ponderosa Lodge, his entry, am ong a dozen obviously hum an ones, read: Dr. Gratiano Forbeson, M irandola, NY. Its Italian Com edy connotations could not fail to strike me, of course. The landlady deigned to inform me that the gentlem an had been laid up for five days with a bad cold, that he had left his car for repairs in som e garage or other and that he had checked out on the 4th of July. Yes, a girl cal ed Ann Lore had worked formerly at the Lodge, but was now married to a grocer in Cedar City. One m oonlit night I waylaid white-shoed M ary on a solitary street; an autom aton, she was about to shriek, but I m anaged to hum anize her by the simple act of fal ing on my knees and with pious yelps imploring her to help. She did not know a thing, she swore. W ho was this Gratiano Forbeson? She seem ed to waver. I whipped out a hundred-dol ar bil . She lifted it to the light of the m oon. "He is your brother," she whispered at last. I plucked the bil out of her m oon-cold hand, and spitting out a French curse turned and ran away. This taught me to rely on myself alone. No detective could discover the clues Trapp had tuned to my mind and m anner. I could not hope, of course, he would ever leave his correct nam e and address; but I did hope he might slip on the glaze of his own subtlety, by daring, say, to introduce a richer and more personal shot of color than strictly necessary, or by revealing too much through a qualitative sum of quantitative parts which revealed too little. In one thing he succeeded: he succeeded in thoroughly enm eshing me and my thrashing anguish in his dem oniacal gam e. W ith infinite skil , he swayed and staggered, and regained an im possible balance, always leaving me with the sportive hope-if I may use such a term in speaking of betrayal, fury, desolation, horror and hate-that he might give himself away next time. He never did-though com ing dam n close to it. W e al adm ire the spangled acrobat with classical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in the taclum light; but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert wearing scarecrow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk! I should know. The clues he left did not establish his identity but they reflected his personality, or at least a certain hom ogenous and striking personality; his genre, his type of hum or-at its best at leat-the tone of his brain, had affinities with my own. He mimed and m ocked me. His al usions were definitely highbrow. He was wel -read. He knew French. he was versed in logodaedaly and logom ancy. He was an am ateur of sex lore. He had a fem inine handwriting. He would change his nam e but he could not disguise, no matter how he slanted them , his very peculiar t's, w's and l's. Quelquepart Island was one of his favorite residences. He did not use a fountain pen which fact, as any psychoanalyst wil tel you, m eant that the patient was a repressed undinist. One merciful y hopes there are water nym phs in the Styx.

His main trait was his passion for tantalization. Goodness, what a tease the poor fel ow was! He chal enged my scholarship. I am sufficiently proud of my knowing som ething to be m odest about my not knowing al ; and I daresay I missed som e elem ents in that cryprogrammic paper chase. W hat a shiver of trium ph and loathing shook my frail fram e when, am ong the plain innocent nam es in the hotel recorder, his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate in my face! I noticed that whenever he felt his enigm as were becom ing Page 124

too recondite, even for such a solver as I, he would lure me back with an easy one.

"ArsÃ¨ne Lupin" was obvious to a Frenchm an who rem em bered the detective stories of his youth; and one hardly had to be a Coleridgian to appreciate the trite poke of "A. Person, Porlock, England." In horrible taste but basical y suggestive of a cultured m annot a policem an, not a com m on good, not a lewd salesm an-were such assum ed nam es as

"Arthur Rainbow"-plainly the travestied author of Le Bateau Bleu-let me laugh a little too, gentlem en-and "M orris Schm etterling," of L'Oiseau Ivre fam e (touchÃ©, reader!). The sil y but funny "D. Orgon, Elmira, NY," was from M oliÃ¨re, of course, and because I had quite recently tried to interest Lolita in a fam ous 18th-century play, I welcom ed as an old friend "Harry Bum per, Sheridan, W yo." An ordinary encyclopedia informed me who the peculiar looking "Phineas Quimby, Lebanon, NH" was; and any good Freudian, with a German nam e and som e interest in religious prostitution, should recognize at a glance the implication of "Dr. Kitzler, Eryx, M iss." So far so good. That sort of fun was shoddy but on the whole impersonal and thus innocuous. Am ong entries that arrested my attention as undoubtable clues per se but baffled me in respect to their finer points I do not care to mention many since I feel I am groping in a border-land mist with verbal phantom s turning, perhaps, into living vacationists. W ho was "Johnny Randal , Ram ble, Ohio"? Or was he a real person who just happened to write a hand similar to "N.S. Aristoff, Catagela, NY"? W hat was the sting in "Catagela"? And what about "Jam es M

avor M orel , Hoaxton, England"? "Aristophanes," "hoax"-fine, but what was I missing?

There was one strain running through al that pseudonym ity which caused me especial y painful palpitations when I cam e across it. Such things as "G. Trapp, Geneva, NY." was the sign of treachery on Lolita's part. "Aubrey Beardsley, Quelquepart Island" suggested more lucidly than the garbled telephone m essage had that the starting point of the affair should be looked for in the East. "Lucas Picador, M errym ay, Pa." insinuated that my Carmen had betrayed my pathetic endearments to the im postor. Horribly cruel, forsooth, was "W il Brown, Dolores, Colo." The gruesom e "Harold Haze, Tom bstone, Arizona" (which at another time would have appealed to my sense of hum or) implied a fam iliarity with the girl's past that in nightmare fashion suggested for a moment that my quarry was an old friend of the fam ily, maybe an old flam e of Charlotte's, maybe a redresser of wrongs ("Donald Quix, Sierra, Nev."). But the most penetrating bodkin was the anagram tailed entry in the register of Chestnut Lodge "Ted Hunter, Cane, NH." The garbled license num bers left by al these Persons and Orgons and M orel s and Trapps only told me that motel keepers om it to check if guests' cars are accurately listed. Referenesincom pletely or incorrectly indicated-to the cars the fiend had hired for short laps between W ace and Elphinstone were of course useless; the license of the initial Aztec was a shimmer of shifting num erals, som e transposed, others altered or om itted, but som ehow forming interrelated com binations (such as "W S 1564" and "SH 1616," and

"Q32888" or "CU88322") which however were so cunningly contrived as to never reveal a com m on denom inator.

It occurred to me that after he had turned that convertible over to accom plices at W ace and switched to the stage-motor car system , his successors might have been less careful and might have inscribed at som e hotel office the archtype of those interrelated figures. But if looking for the fiend along a road I knew he had taken was such a com plicated vague and unprofitable business, what could I expect from any attem pt to trace unknown motorists traveling along unknown routes?

24

By the time I reached Beardsley, in the course of the harrowing recapitulation I have now discussed at sufficient length, a com plete image had formed in my mind; and through the-always risky-process of elimination I had reduced this image to the only concrete Page 125

source that morbid cerebration and torpid memory could give it. Except for the Rev. Rigor M ortis (as the girls cal ed him), and an old gentlem an who taught non-obligatory German and Latin, there were no regular male teachers t Beardsley School. But on two occasions an art instructor on the Beardsley Col ege faculty had com e over to show the schoolgirls magic lantern pictures of French castles and nineteenthcentury paintings. I had wanted to attend those projections and talks, but Dol y, as was her wont, had asked me not to, period. I also rem em bered that Gaston had referred to that particular lecturer as a bril iant garÃ§on; but that was al ; memory refused to supply me with the nam e of the chateau-lover.

On the day fixed for the execution, I walked though the sleet across the cam pus to the information desk in M aker Hal , Beardsley Col ege. There I learned that the fel ow's nam e was Riggs (rather like that of the minister), that he was a bachelor, and that in ten minutes he would issue from the "M useum " where he was having a class. In the passage leading to the auditorium I sat on a marble bench of sorts donated by Cecilia Dalrym ple Ram ble. As I waited there, in the prostatic discom fort, drunk, sleep-starved, with my gun in my fist in my raincoat pocket, it suddenly occurred to me that I was dem ented and was about to do som ething stupid. There was not one chance in a mil ion that Albert Riggs, Ass. Prof., was hiding my Lolita at his Beardsley hom e, 24 Pritchard Road. He could not be the vil ain. It was absolutely preposterous. I was losing my time and my wits. He and she were in California and not here at al .

Presently, I noticed a vague commotion behind som e white statues; a door-not the one I had been staring at-opened briskly, and am id a bevy of women students a baldish head and two bright brown eyes bobbed, advanced.

He was a total stranger to me but insisted we had met at a lawn party at Beardsley School. How was my delightful tennis-playing daughter? He had another class. He would be seeing me.

Another attem pt at identification was less speedily resolved: through an advertisem ent in one of Lo's magazines I dared to get in touch with a private detective, an ex-pugilist, and merely to give him som e idea of the method adopted by the fiend, I acquainted him with the kind of nam es and addresses I had col ected. He dem anded a goodish deposit and for two years-two years, reader!-that im becile busied himself with checking those nonsense data. I had long severed al m onetary relations with him when he turned up one day with the trium phant information that an eighty-year-old Indian by the nam e of Bil Brown lived near Dolores, Colo.

This book is about Lolita; and now that I have reached the part which (had I not been forestal ed by another internal com bustion martyr) might be cal ed "DolorÃ¨s Disparue," there would be little sense in analyzing the three em pty years that fol owed. W hile a few pertinent points have to be marked, the general impression I desire to convey is of a side door crashing open in life's ful flight, and a rush of roaring black time drowning with its whipping wind the cry of lone disaster.

Singularly enough, I seldom if ever dream ed of Lolita as I rem em bered her-as I saw her constantly and obsessively in my conscious mind during my daym ares and insom nias. M ore precisely: she did haunt my sleep but she appeared there in strange and ludicrous disguises as Valeria or Charlotte, or a cross between them . That com plex ghost would com e to me, shedding shift after shift, in an atm osphere of great melancholy and disgust, and would recline in dul invitation on som e narrow board or hard settee, with flesh ajar like the rubber valve of a soccer bal 's bladder. I would bind myself, dentures fractured or hopelessly mislaid, in horrible cham bres garnies where I would be entertained at tedious vivisecting parties that general y ended with Charlotte or Valeria weeping in my bleeding arms and being tenderly kissed by my brotherly lips in a dream disorder of auctioneered Page 126

One day I rem oved from the car and destroyed an accum ulation of teen-magazines. You know the sort. Stone age at heart; up to date, or at least M ycenaean, as to hygiene. A handsom e, very ripe actress with huge lashes and a pulpy red underlip, endorsing a sham poo. Ads and fads. Young scholars dote on plenty of pleats-que c'Ã©tait loin, tout cela! It is your hostess' duty to provide robes. Unattached details take al the sparkle out of your conversation. Al of us have known "pickers"-one who picks her cuticle at the office party. Unless he is very elderly or very im portant, a man should rem ove his gloves before shaking hands with a woman. Invite Rom ance by wearing the Exciting New Tummy Flattener. Trims tum s, nips hips.

Other things of hers were harder to relinquish. Up to the end of 1949, I cherished and adored, and stained with my kisses and merman tears, a pair of old sneakers, a boy's shirt she had worn, som e ancient blue jeans I found in the trunk com partment, a crum pled school cap, suchlike wanton treasures. Then, when I understood my mind was cracking, I col ected those sundry belongings, added to them what had been stored in Beardsley-a box of books, her bicycle, old coats, galoshes-and on her fifteenth birthday mailed everything as an anonym ous gift to a hom e for orphaned girls on a windy lake, on the Canadian border.

It is just possible that had I gone to a strong hypnotist he might have extracted from me and arrayed in a logical pattern certain chance memories that I have threaded through my book with considerably more ostentation than they present them selves with to my mind even now when I know what to seek in the past. At the time I felt I was merely losing contact with reality; and after spending the rest of the winter and most of the fol owing spring in a Quebec sanatorium where I had stayed before, I resolved first to settle som e affairs of mine in New York and then to proceed to California for a thorough search there. Here is som ething I com posed in my retreat:

W anted, wanted: Dolores Haze.

Hair: brown. Lips: scarlet.

Age: five thousand three hundred days.

Profession: none, or "starlet."

W here are you hiding, Dolores Haze?

W hy are you hiding, darling?

(I talk in a daze, I walk in a maze,

I cannot get out, said the starling).

W here are you riding, Dolores Haze?

W hat make is the magic carpet?

Is a Cream Cougar the present craze?

And where are you parked, my car pet?

W ho is your hero, Dolores Haze?

Stil one of those blue-caped star-men?

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

Oh the balmy days and the palmy bays,

And the cars, and the bars, my Carmen!

Oh Dolores, that juke-box hurts!

Are you stil dancin', darlin'?

(Both in worn levis, both in torn T-shirts,

And I, in my corner, snarlin').

Happy, happy is gnarled M cFate

Touring the States with a child wife,

Plowing his M ol y in every State

Am ong the protected wild life.

M y Dol y, my fol y! Her eyes were vair,

And never closed when I kissed her.

Know an old perfum e cal ed Soleil Vert?

Are you from Paris, mister?

L'autre soir un air froid d'opÃ©ra m'alita:

Son fÃ©tÃ©-bien fol est qui s'y fie!

Il neige, le dÃ©cor s'Ã©croule, Lolita!

Lolita, qu'ai-je fait de ta vie?

Dying, dying, Lolita Haze,

Of hate and rem orse, I'm dying.

And again my hairy fist I raise,

And again I hear you crying.

Officer, officer, there they go-In the rain, where that lighted store is!

And her socks are white, and I love her so,

And her nam e is Haze, Dolores.

Officer, officer, there they are-Dolores Haze and her lover!

W hip out your gun and fol ow that car.

Now tum ble out, and take cover.

W anted, wanted: Dolores Haze.

Her dream -gray gaze never flinches.

Ninety pounds is al she weighs

W ith a height of sixty inches.

M y car is limping, Dolores Haze,

And the last long lap is the hardest,

And I shal be dum ped where the weed decays,

And the rest is rust and stardust.

By psychoanalyzing this poem , I notice it is real y a maniac's masterpiece. The stark, stiff, lurid rhym es correspond very exactly to certain perspectiveless and terrible landscapes and figures, and magnified parts of landscapes and figures, as drawn by psychopaths in tests devised by their astute trainers. I wrote many more poem s. I immersed myself in the poetry of others. But not for a second did I forget the load of revenge.

I would be a knave to say, and the reader a fool to believe, that the shock of losing Lolita cured me of pederosis. M y accursed nature could not change, no matter how my love for her did. On playgrounds and beaches, my sul en and stealthy eye, against my wil , stil sought out the flash of a nym phet's limbs, the sly tokens of Lolita's handm aids and rosegirls. But one essential vision in me had withered: never did I dwel now on possibilities of bliss with a little maiden, specific or synthetic, in som e out-of-the-way place; never did my fancy sink its fangs into Lolita's sisters, far far away, in the coves of Page 128

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

evoked islands. That was al over, for the time being at least. On the other hand, alas, two years of m onstrous indulgence had left me with certain habits of lust: I feared lest the void I lived in might drive me to plunge into the freedom of sudden insanity when confronted with a chance tem ptation in som e lane between school and supper. Solitude was corrupting me. I needed com pany and care. M y heart was a hysterical unreliable organ. This is how Rita enters the picture.

26

She was twice Lolita's age and three quarters of mine: a very slight, dark-haired, paleskinned adult, weighing a hundred and five pounds, with charmingly asymmetrical eyes, and angular, rapidly sketched profile, and a most appealing ensel ure to her supple back-I think she had som e Spanish or Babylonian blood. I picked her up one depraved M ay evening som ewhere between M ontreal and New York, or more narrowly, between Toylestown and Blake, at a drakishly burning bar under the sign of the Tigermoth, where she was am iably drunk: she insisted we had gone to school together, and she placed her trem bling little hand on my ape paw. M y senses were very slightly stirred but I decided to give her a try; I did-and adopted her as a constant com panion. She was so kind, was Rita, such a good sport, that I daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature or fal acy, an old broken tree or a bereaved porcupine, out of sheer chumminess and com passion.

W hen I first met her she had but recently divorced her third husband-and a little more recently had been abandoned by her seventh cavalier servant-the others, the mutables, were too num erous and m obile to tabulate. Her brother was-and no doubt stil is-a prom inent, pasty-faced, suspenders-and-painted-tie-wearing politician, mayor and booster of his bal -playing, Bible-reading, grain-handling hom e town. For the last eight years he had been paying his great little sister several hundred dol ars per m onth under the stringent condition that she would never never enter great little Grainbal City. She told me, with wails of wonder, that for som e God-dam n reason every new boy friend of hers would first of al take her Grainbal -ward: it was a fatal attraction; and before she knew what was what, she would find herself sucked into the lunar orbit of the town, and would be fol owing the flood-lit drive that encircled it-"going round and round," as she phrased it, "like a God-dam n mulberry moth."

She had a natty little coupÃ©; and in it we traveled to California so as to give my venerable vehicle a rest. her natural speed was ninety. Dear Rita! W e cruised together for two dim years, from summer 1950 to summer 1952, and she was the sweetest, simplest, gentles, dum best Rita imaginable. In com parison to her, Valechak was A Schlegel, and Charlotte a Hegel. There is no earthly reason why I should dal y with her in the margin of this sinister memoir, but let me say (hi, Rita-wherever you are, drunk or hangoverish, Rita, hi!) that she was the most soothing, the most com prehending com panion that I ever had, and certainly saved me from the m adhouse. I told her I was trying to trace a girl and plug that girl's bul y. Rita solem nly approved of the plan-and in the course of som e investigation she undertook on her own (without real y knowing a thing), around San Humbertino, got entangled with a pretty awful crook herself; I had the devil of a time retrieving her-used and bruised but stil cocky. Then one day she proposed playing Russian roulette with my sacred autom atic; I said you couldn't, it was not a revolver, and we struggled for it, until at last it went off, touching off a very thin and very com ical spurt of hot water from the hole it made in the wal of the cabin room ; I rem em ber her shrieks of laughter.

The oddly prepubescent curve of her back, her ricey skin, her slow languorous colum bine kisses kept me from mischief. It is not the artistic aptitudes that are secondary sexual characters as som e sham s and sham ans have said; it is the other way around: sex is but the ancil a of art. One rather mysterious spree that had interesting repercussions I must Page 129

notice. I had abandoned the search: the fiend was either in Tartary or burning away in my cerebel um (the flam es fanned by my fancy and grief) but certainly not having Dolores Haze play cham pion tennis on the Pacific Coast. One afternoon, on our way back East, in a hideous hotel, the kind where they hold conventions and where labeled, fat, pink men stagger around, al first nam es and business and booze-dear Rita and I awoke to find a third in our room , a blond, almost albino, young fel ow with white eyelashes and large transparent ears, whom neither Rita nor I recal ed having ever seen in our sad lives. Sweating in thick dirty underwear, and with old army boots on, he lay snoring on the double bed beyond my chaste Rita. One of his front teeth was gone, am ber pustules grew on his forehead. Ritochka enveloped her sinuous nudity in my raincoat-the first thing at hand; I slipped on a pair of candy-striped drawers; and we took stock of the situation. Five glasses had been used, which in the way of clues, was an em barrassm ent of riches. The door was not properly closed. A sweater and a pair of shapeless tan pants lay on the floor. W e shook their owner into miserable consciousness. He was com pletely am nesic. In an accent that Rita recognized as pure Brooklynese, he peevishly insinuated that som ehow we had purloined his (worthless) identity. W e rushed him into his clothes and left him at the nearest hospital, realizing on the way that som ehow or other after forgotten gyrations, we ewer in Grainbal . Half a year later Rita wrote the doctor for news. Jack Humbertson as he had been tastelessly dubbed was stil isolated from his personal past. Oh M nem osyne, sweetest and most mischievous of m uses!

I would not have mentioned this incident had it not started a chain of ideas that resulted in my publishing in the Cantrip Review an essay on "M imir and M emory," in which I suggested am ong other things that seem ed original and im portant to that splendid review's benevolent readers, a theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and conceptual y depending (to fil up this nutshel ) on the mind's being conscious not only of matter but also of its own self, thus crating a continuous spanning of two points (the storable future and the stored past). In result of this venture-and in culmination of the impression made by my previous travaux-I was cal ed from New York, where Rita and I were living in a little flat with a view of gleam ing children taking shower baths far below in a fountainous arbor of Central Park, to Cantrip Col ege, four hundred miles away, for one year. I lodged there, in special apartments for poets and philosophers, from Septem ber 1951 to June 1952, while Rita whom I preferred not to display vegetated-som ewhat indecorously, I am afraid-in a roadside inn where I visited her twice a week. Then she vanished-m ore hum anly than her predecessor had done: a m onth later I found her in the local jail. She was trÃ¨s digne, had had her appendix rem oved, and m anaged to convince me that the beautiful bluish furs she had been accused of stealing from a M rs. Roland M acCrum had real y been a spontaneous, if som ewhat alcoholic, gift from Roland himself. I succeeded in getting her out without appealing to her touchy brother, and soon afterwards we drove back to Central Park W est, by way of Briceland, where we had stopped for a few hours the year before. A curious urge to relive my stay there with Lolita had got hold of me. I was entering a phase of existence where I had given up al hope of tracing her kidnapper and her. I now attem pted to fal back on old settings in order to save what stil could be saved in the way of souvenir, souvenir que me veux-tu?

Autum n was ringing in the air. To a post card requesting twin beds Professor Ham burg got a prom pt expression of regret in reply. They were ful up. They had one bathless basem ent room with four beds which they thought I would not want. Their note paper was headed:

The Enchanted Hunters

Near Churches

No Dogs

Al legal beverages

Page 130

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

I wondered if the last statem ent was true. Al ? Did they have for instance sidewalk grenadine? I also wondered if a hunter, enchanted or otherwise, would not need a pointer more than a pew, and with a spasm of pain I recal ed a scene worthy of a great artist: petite nym phe accroupie; but that silky cocker spaniel had perhaps been a baptized one. No-I felt I could not endure the throes of revisiting that lobby. There was a much better possibility of retrievable time elsewhere in soft, rich-colored, autum nal Briceland. Leaving Rita in a bar, I made for the town library. A twittering spinster was only too glad to help me disinter mid-August 1947 from the bound Briceland Gazette, and presently, in a secluded nook under a naked light, I was turning the enorm ous and fragile pages of a coffin-black volum e almost as big as Lolita.

Reader! Bruder! W hat a foolish Ham burg that Ham burg was! Since his supersensitive system was loath to face the actual scene, he thought he could at least enjoy a secret part of it-which rem inds one of the tenth or twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girl's black shawl over her white face so as not to see those im possible eyes while taking his military pleasure in the sad, sacked vil age. W hat I lusted to get was the printed picture that had chanced to absorb my trespassing image while the Gazette's photographer was concentrating on Dr. Braddock and his group. Passionately I hoped to find preserved the portrait of the artist as a younger brute. An innocent cam era catching me on my dark way to Lolita's bed-what a magnet for M nem osyne! I cannot wel explain the true nature of that urge of mine. It was al ied, I suppose, to that swooning curiosity which impels one to exam ine with a magnifying glass bleak little figures-stil life practical y, and everybody about to throw up-at an early morning execution, and the patient's expression im possible to make out in the print. Anyway, I was literal y gasping for breath, and one corner of the book of doom kept stabbing me in the stom ach while I scanned and skimmed . . . Brute Force and Possessed were com ing on Sunday, the 24th, to both theatres. M r. Purdom , independent tobacco auctioneer, said that ever since 1925

he had been an Omen Faustum sm oker. Husky Hank and his petite bride were to be the guests of M r. and M rs. Reginald G. Gore, 58 Inchkeith Ave. The size of certain parasites is one sixth of the host. Dunkerque was fortified in the tenth century. M isses' socks, 39 c. Saddle Oxfords 3.98. W ine, wine, wine, quipped the author of Dark Age who refused to be photographed, may suit a Persuan bubble bird, but I say give me rain, rain, rain on the shingle roof for roses and inspiration every time. Dimples are caused by the adherence of the skin to the deeper tissues. Greeks repulse a heavy guerril a assault-and, ah, at last, a little figure in white, and Dr. Braddock in black, but whatever spectral shoulder was brushing against his am ple form - nothing of myself could I make out. I went to find Rita who introduced me with her vin triste sm ile to a pocket-sized wizened truculently tight old man saying this was-what was the nam e again, son?-a former schoolmate of hers. He tried to retain her, and in the slight scuffle that fol owed I hurt my thum b against his hard head. In the silent painted part where I walked her and aired her a little, she sobbed and said I would soon, soon leave her as everybody had, and I sang her a wistful French bal ad, and strung together som e fugitive rhym es to am use her: The place was cal ed Enchanted Hunters. Query:

W hat Indian dyes, Diana, did thy del

endorses to make of Picture Lake a very

blood bath of trees before the blue hotel?

She said: "W hy blue when it is white, why blue for heaven's sake?" and started to cry again, and I marched her to the car, and we drove on to New York, and soon she was reasonably happy again high up in the haze on the little terrace of our flat. I notice I have som ehow mixed up two events, my visit with Rita to Briceland on our way to Carntrip, and our passing through Briceland again on our way back to New York, but such suffusions of swimming colors are not to be disdained by the artist in recol ection. Page 131

M y letterbox in the entrance hal belonged to the type that al ows one to glimpse som ething of its contents through a glassed slit. Several times already, a trick of harlequin light that fel through the glass upon an alien handwriting had twisted it into a sem blance of Lolita's script causing me almost to col apse as I leant against an adjacent urn, almost my own. W henever that happened-whenever her lovely, childish scrawl was horribly transformed into the dul hand of one of my few correspondents-I used to recol ect, with anguished am usem ent, the times in my trustful, pre-dolorian past when I would be misled by a jewel-bright window opposite wherein my lurking eye, the ever alert periscope of my sham eful vice, would make out from afar a half-naked nym phet stil ed in the act of com bing her Alice-in-W onderland hair. There was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which made my wild delight also perfect, just because the vision was out of reach, with no possibility of attainm ent to spoil it by the awareness of an appended taboo; indeed, it may wel be that the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fil the gap between the little given and the great prom ised-the great rosegray never-to-be-had. M es fenÃªtres! Hanging above blotched sunset and wel ing night, grinding my teeth, I would crowd al the dem ons of my desire against the railing of a throbbing balcony: it would be ready to take off in the apricot and black hum id evening; did take off-whereupon the lighted image would m ove and Even would revert to a rib, and there would be nothing in the window but an obese partly clad man reading the paper.

Since I som etimes won the race between my fancy and nature's reality, the deception was bearable. Unbearable pain began when chance entered the fray and deprived me of the sm ile m eant for me. "Savez-vous qu'Ã dix ans ma petite Ã©tait fol e de voius?" said a woman I talked to at a tea in Paris, and the petite had just married, miles away, and I could not even rem em ber if I had ever noticed her in that garden, next to those tennis courts, a dozen years before. And now likewise, the radiant foreglimpse, the prom ise of reality, a prom ise not only to be simulated seductively but also to be nobly held-al this, chance denied m e-chance and a change to sm al er characters on the pale beloved writer's part. M y fancy was both Proustianized and Procrusteanized; for that particular morning, late in Septem ber 1952, as I had com e down to grope for my mail, the dapper and bilious janitor with whom I was on execrable terms started to com plain that a man who had seen Rita hom e recently had been "sick like a dog" on the front steps. In the process of listening to him and tipping him, and then listening to a revised and politer version of the incident, I had the impression that one of the two letters which that blessed mail brought was from Rita's mother, a crazy little woman, whom we had once visited on Cape Cod and who kept writing me to my various addresses, saying how wonderful y wel matched her daughter and I were, and how wonderful it would be if we married; the other letter which I opened and scanned rapidly in the elevator was from John Farlow. I have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader's mind. No matter how many times we reopen

"King Lear," never shal we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry, al woes forgotten, at a jol y reunion with al three daughters and their lapdogs. Never wil Emma ral y, revived by the sym pathetic salts in Flaubert's father's timely tear. W hatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to fol ow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them . Thus X wil never com pose the immortal music that would clash with the second-rate sym phonies he has accustom ed us to. Y wil never commit murder. Under no circum stances can Z ever betray us. W e have it al arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular Page 132

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. Any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anom alous but unethical. W e would prefer not to have known at al our neighbor, the retired hot-dog stand operator, if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen.

I am saying al this in order to explain how bewildered I was by Farlow's hysterical letter. I knew his wife had died but I certainly expected him to rem ain, throughout a devout widowhood, the dul , sedate and reliable person he had always been. Now he wrote that after a brief visit to the U.S. he had returned to South America and had decided that whatever affairs he had control ed at Ram sdale he would hand over to Jack W indm ul er of that town, a lawyer whom we both knew. He seem ed particularly relieved to get rid of the Haze "com plications." He had married a Spanish girl. He had stopped sm oking and had gained thirty pounds. She was very young and a ski cham pion. They were going to India for their honeym onsoon. Since he was "building a fam ily" as he put it, he would have no time henceforth for my affairs which he termed "very strange and very aggravating." Busybodies-a whole committee of them , it appeared-had informed him that the whereabouts of little Dol y Haze were unknown, and that I was living with a notorious divorcee in California. His father-in-law was a count, and exceedingly wealthy. The people who had been renting the Haze house for som e years now wished to buy it. He suggested that I better produce Dol y quick. he had broken his leg. He enclosed a snapshot of himself and a brunette in white wool beam ing at each other am ong the snows of Chile.

I rem em ber letting myself into my flat and starting to say: W el , at least we shal now track them down-when the other letter began talking to me in a sm al matter-of-fact voice:

Dear Dad:

How's everything? I'm married. I'm going to have a baby. I guess he's going to be a big one. I guess he'l com e right for Christmas. This is a hard letter to write. I'm going nuts because we don't have enough to pay our debts and get out of here. Dick is prom ised a big job in Alaska in his very specialized corner of the m echanical field, that's al I know about it but it's real y grand. Pardon me for withholding our hom e address but you may stil be mad at me, and Dick must not know. This town is som ething. You can't see the morons for the sm og. Please do send us a check, Dad. W e could manage with three or four hundred or even less, anything is welcom e, you might sel my old things, because once we go there the dough wil just start rol ing in. W rit, please. I have gone through much sadness and hardship.

Yours expecting,

Dol y (M rs. Richard F. Schil er)

28

I was again on the road, again at the wheel of the old blue sedan, again alone. Rita had stil been dead to the world when I read that letter and fought the m ountains of agony it raised within me. I had glanced at her as she sm iled in her sleep and had kissed her on her moist brow, and had left her forever, with a note of tender adieu which I taped to her navel-otherwise she might not have found it.

"Alone" did I say? Pas tout Ã fait. I had my little black chum with me, and as soon as I reached a secluded spot, I rehearsed M r. Richard F. Schil er's violent death. I had found a very old and very dirty gray sweater of mine in the back of the car, and this I hung up on a branch, in a speechless glade, which I had reached by a wood road from the now rem ote highway. The carrying out of the sentence was a little marred by what seem ed to me a certain stiffness in the play of the trigger, and I wondered if I should get som e oil for the mysterious thing but decided I had no time to spare. Back into the car went the old dead Page 133

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

sweater, now with additional perforations, and having reloaded warm Chum , I continued my journey.

The letter was dated Septem ber 18, 1952 (this was Septem ber 22), and the address she gave was "General Delivery, Coalm ont" (not "Va.," not "Pa.," not "Tenn."-and not Coalm ont, anyway-I have cam ouflaged everything, my love). Inquiries showed this to be a sm al industrial com m unity som e eight hundred miles from New York City. At first I planned to drive al day and al night, but then thought better of it and rested for a couple of hours around dawn in a motor court room , a few miles before reaching the town. I had made up my mind that the fiend, this Schil er, had been a car salesm an who had perhaps got to know my Lolita by giving her a ride in Beardsley-the day her bike blew a tire on the way to M iss Em peror-and that he had got into som e trouble since then. The corpse of the executed sweater, no matter how I changed its contours as it lay on the back seat of the car, had kept revealing various outlines pertaining to Trapp-Schil er-the grossness and obscene bonhom ie of his body, and to counteract this taste of coarse corruption I resolved to make myself especial y handsom e and sm art as I pressed hom e the nipple of my alarm clock before it exploded at the set hour of six a.m. Then, with the stern and rom antic care of a gentlem an about to fight a duel, I checked the arrangem ent of my papers, bathed and perfum ed my delicate body, shaved my face and chest, selected a silk shirt and clean drawers, pul ed on transparent taupe socks, and congratulated myself for having with me in my trunk som e very exquisite clothes-a waistcoat with nacreous buttons, for instance, a pale cashm ere tie and so on. I was not able, alas, to hold my breakfast, but dism issed that physicality as a trivial contretem ps, wiped my m outh with a gossam er handkerchief produced from my sleeve, and, with a blue block of ice for heart, a pil on my tongue and solid death in my hip pocket, I stepped neatly into a telephone booth in Coalm ont (Ah-ah-ah, said its little door) and rang up the only Schil er-Paul, Furniture-to be found in the battered book. Hoarse Paul told me he did know a Richard, the son of a cousin of his, and his address was, let me see, 10 Kil er Street (I am not going very far for my pseudonym s). Ah-ah-ah, said the little door.

At 10 Kil er Street, a tenem ent house, I interviewed a num ber of dejected old people and two long-haired strawberry-blond incredibly grubby nym phets (rather abstractly, just for the heck of it, the ancient beast in me was casting about for som e lightly clad child I might hold against me for a minute, after the kil ing was over and nothing mattered any more, and everything was al owed). Yes, Dick Skil er had lived there, but had m oved when he married. Nobody knew his address. "They might know at the store," said a bass voice from an open m anhole near which I happened to be standing with the two thinarmed, barefoot little girls and their dim grandm others. I entered the wrong store and a wary old Negro shook his head even before I could ask anything. I crossed over to a bleak grocery and there, sum m oned by a custom er at my request, a woman's voice from som e wooden abyss in the floor, the m anhole's counterpart, cried out: Hunter Road, last house.

Hunter Road was miles away, in an even more dism al district, al dum p and ditch, and wormy vegetable garden, and shack, and gray drizzle, and red m ud, and several sm oking stacks in the distance. I stopped at the last "house"-a clapboard shack, with two or three similar ones farther away from the road and a waste of withered weeds al around. Sounds of hammering cam e from behind the house, and for several minutes I sat quite stil in my old car, old and frail, at the end of my journey, at my gray goal, finis, my friends, finis, my friends. The time was around two. M y pulse was 40 one minute and 100

the next. The drizzle crepitated against the hood of the car. M y gun had migrated to my right trouser pocket. A nondescript cur cam e out from behind the house, stopped in surprise, and started good-naturedly woof-woofing at me, his eyes slit, his shaggy bel y Page 134

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

al m uddy, and then walked about a little and woofed once more. 29

I got out of the car and slammed its door. How matter-of-fact, how square that slam sounded in the void of the sunless day! W oof, commented the dog perfunctorily. I pressed the bel button, it vibrated through my whole system . Personne. Je resonne. Repersonne. From what depth this re-nonsense? W oof, said the dog. A rush and a shuffle, and woosh-woof went the door.

Couple of inches tal er. Pink-rimmed glasses. New, heaped-up hairdo, new ears. How simple! The moment, the death I had kept conjuring up for three years was as simple as a bit of dry wood. She was frankly and hugely pregnant. Her head looked sm al er (only two seconds had passed real y, but let me give them as much wooden duration as life can stand), and her pale-freckled cheeks were hol owed, and her bare shins and arms had lost al their tan, so that the little hairs showed. She wore a brown, sleeveless cotton dress and sloppy felt slippers.

"W e-e-el !" she exhaled after a pause with al the em phasis of wonder and welcom e.

"Husband at hom e?" I croaked, fist in pocket.

I could not kil her, of course, as som e have thought. You see, I loved her. It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.

"Com e in," she said with a vehem ent cheerful note. Against the splintery deadwood of the door, Dol y Schil er flattened herself as best she could (even rising on tiptoe a little) to let me pass, and was crucified for a moment, looking down, sm iling down at the threshold, hol ow-cheeked with round pommettes, her watered-milk-white arms outspread on the wood. I passed without touching her bulging babe. Dol y-sm el , with a faint fried addition. M y teeth chattered like an idiot's. "No, you stay out" (to the dog). She closed the door and fol owed me and her bel y into the dol house parlor.

"Dick's down there," she said pointing with an invisible tennis racket, inviting my gaze to travel from the drab parlor-bedroom where we stood, right across the kitchen, and through the back doorway where, in a rather primitive vista, a dark-haired young stranger in overal s, instantaneously reprieved, was perched with his back to me on a ladder fixing som ething near or upon the shack of his neighbor, a plum per fel ow with only one arm, who stood looking up.

This pattern she explained from afar, apologetical y ("M en wil be men"); should she cal him in?

No.

Standing in the middle of the slanting room and em itting questioning "hm 's," she made fam iliar Javanese gestures with her wrists and hands, offering me, in a brief display of hum orous courtesy, to choose between a rocker and the divan (their bed after ten p.m.). I say "fam iliar" because one day she had welcom ed me with the sam e wrist dance to her party in Beardsley. W e both sat down on the divan. Curious: although actual y her looks had faded, I definitely realized, so hopelessly late in the day, how much she lookedhad always looked-like Botticel i's russet Venus-the sam e soft nose, the sam e blurred beauty. In my pocket my fingers gently let go and repacked a little at the tip, within the handkerchief it was nested in, my unused weapon.

"that's not the fel ow I want," I said.

The diffuse look of welcom e left her eyes. Her forehead puckered as in the old bitter days:

"Not who?"

"W here is he? Quick!"

"Look," she said, inclining her head to one side and shaking it in that position. "Look, you are not going to bring that up."

"I certainly am ," I said, and for a moment-strangely enough the only merciful, Page 135

endurable one in the whole interview-we were bristling at each other as if she were stil mine.

A wise girl, she control ed herself.

Dick did not know a thing of the whole m ess. He thought I was her father. He thought she had run away from an upper-class hom e just to wash dishes in a diner. He believed anything. W hy should I want to make things harder than they were by raking up al that muck?

But, I said, she must be sensible, she must be a sensible girl (with her bare drum under that thin brown stuff), she must understand that if she expected the help I had com e to give, I must have at least a clear com prehension of the situation.

"Com e, his nam e!"

She thought I had guessed long ago. It was (with a mischievous and melancholy sm ile) such a sensational nam e. I would never believe it. She could hardly believe it herself. His nam e, my fal nym ph.

It was so unim portant, she said. She suggested I skip it. W ould I like a cigarette?

No. His nam e.

She shook her head with great resolution. She guessed it was too late to raise hel and I would never believe the unbelievably unbelievable-I said I had better go, regards, nice to have seen her. She said real y it was useless, she would never tel , but on the other hand, after al -"Do you real y want to know who it was? W el , it was-" And softly, confidential y, arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her parched lips, she em itted, a little mockingly, som ewhat fastidiously, not untenderly, in a kind of muted whistle, the nam e that the astute reader has guessed long ago. W aterproof. W hy did a flash from Hourglass Lake cross my consciousness? I, too, had known it, without knowing it, al along. There was no shock, no surprise. Quietly the fusion took place, and everything fel into order, into the pattern of branches that I have woven throughout this memoir with the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fal at the right moment; yes, with the express and perverse purpose of rendering-she was talking but I sat melting in my golden peace-of rendering that golden and m onstrous peace through the satisfaction of logical recognition, which my most inimical reader should experience now. She was, as I say, talking. It now cam e in a relaxed flow. He was the only man she had ever been crazy about. W hat about Dick? Oh, Dick was a lam b, they were quite happy together, but she m eant som ething different. And I had never counted, of course?

She considered me as if grasping al at once the incredible-and som ehow tedious, confusing and unnecessary-fact that the distant, elegant, slender, forty-year-old valetudinarian in velvet coat sitting beside her had known and adored every pore and fol icle of her pubescent body. In her washed-out gray eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor rom ance was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dism issed like a dul party, like a rainy picnic to which only the dul est bores had com e, like a hum drum exercise, like a bit of dry m ud caking her childhood.

I just m anaged to jerk my knee out of the range of a sketchy tap-one of her acquired gestures.

She asked me not to be dense. The past was the past. I had been a good father, she guessed-granting me that. Proceed, Dol y Schil er.

W el , did I know that he had known her mother? That he was practical y an old friend?

That he had visited with his uncle in Ram sdale?-oh, years ago-and spoken at M other's club, and had tugged and pul ed her, Dol y, by her bare arm onto his lap in front of everybody, and kissed her face, she was ten and furious with him? Did I know he had seen me and her at the inn where he was writing the very play she was to rehearse in Page 136

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

Beardsley, two years later? Did I know-It had been horrid of her to sidetrack me into believing that Clare was an old fem ale, maybe a relative of his or a som etime lifem ateand oh, what a close shave it had been when the W ace Journal carried his picture. The Briceland Gazette had not. Yes, very am using.

Yes, she said, this world was just one gag after another, if som ebody wrote up her life nobody would ever believe it.

At this point, there cam e brisk hom ey sounds from the kitchen into which Dick and Bil had lum bered in quest of beer. Through the doorway they noticed the visitor, and Dick entered the parlor.

"Dick, this is my Dad!" cried Dol y in a resounding violent voice that struck me as a total y strange, and new, and cheerful, and old, and sad, because the young fel ow, veteran of a rem ote war, was hard of hearing.

Arctic blue eyes, black hair, ruddy cheeks, unshaven chin. W e shook hands. Discreet Bil , who evidently took pride in working wonders with one hand, brought in the beer cans he had opened. W anted to withdraw. The exquisite courtesy of simple folks. W as made to stay. A beer ad. In point of fact, I preferred it that way, and so did the Schil ers. I switched to the jittery rocker. Avidly m unching, Dil y plied me with marshm al ows and potato chips. The men looked at her fragile, frileux, diminutive, old-world, youngish but sickly, father in velvet coat and beige vest, maybe a viscount. They were under the impression I had com e to stay, and Dick with a great wrinkling of brows that denoted difficult thought, suggested Dol y and he might sleep in the kitchen on a spare mattress. I waved a light hand and told Dol y who transm itted it by m eans of a special shout to Dick that I had merely dropped in on my way to Readsburg where I was to be entertained by som e friends and adm irers. It was then noticed that one of the few thum bs rem aining to Bil was bleeding (not such a wonder-worker after al ). How womanish and som ehow never seen that way before was the shadowy division between her pale breasts when she bent down over the man's hand! She took him for repairs to the kitchen. For a few minutes, three or four little eternities which positively wel ed with artificial warmth, Dick and I rem ained alone. He sat on a hard chair rubbing his forelimbs and frowning. I had an idle urge to squeeze out the blackheads on the wings of his perspiring nose with my long agate claws. He had nice sad eyes with beautiful lashes, and very white teeth. His Adam's apple was large and hairy. W hy don't they shave better, those young brawny chaps? He and his Dol y had had unrestrained intercourse on that couch there, at least a hundred and eighty times, probably much more; and before that-how long had she known him? No grudge. Funny-no grudge at al , nothing except grief and nausea. He was now rubbing his nose. I was sure that when final y he would open his m outh, he would say (slightly shaking his head): "Aw, she's a swel kid, M r. Haze. She sure is. And she's going to make a swel mother." He opened his m outh-and took a sip of beer. This gave him countenance-and he went on sipping til he frothed at the m outh. He was a lam b. He had cupped her Florentine breasts. His fingernails were black and broken, but the phalanges, the whole carpus, the strong shapely wrist were far, far finer than mine: I have hurt too much too many bodies with my twisted poor hands to be proud of them . French epithets, a Dorset yokel's knuckles, an Austrian tailor's flat finger tips-that's Humbert Humbert. Good. If he was silent I could be silent too. Indeed, I could very wel do with a little rest in this subdued, frightened-to-death rocking chair, before I drove to wherever the beast's lair was-and then pul ed the pistol's foreskin back, and then enjoyed the orgasm of the crushed trigger: I was always a good little fol ower of the Viennese medicine man. But presently I becam e sorry for poor Dick whom , in som e hypnotoid way, I was horribly preventing from making the only rem ark he could think up ("She's a swel kid. . .").

"And so," I said, "you are going to Canada?" Page 137

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

In the kitchen, Dol y was laughing at som ething Bil had said or done.

"And so," I shouted, "you are going to Canada? Not Canada"-I re-shouted-"I m ean Alaska, of course."

He nursed his glass and, nodding sagely, replied: "W el , he cut it on a jagger, I guess. Lost his right arm in Italy."

Lovely m auve alm ond trees in bloom . A blown-off surrealistic arm hanging up there in the pointil istic m auve. A flowergirl tattoo on the hand. Dol y and band-aided Bil reappeared. It occurred to me that her am biguous, brown and pale beauty excited the cripple. Dick, with a grin of relief stood up. He guessed Bil and he would be going back to fix those wires. He guessed M r. Haze and Dol y had loads of things to say to each other. He guessed he would be seeing me before I left. W hy do those people guess so much and shave so little, and are so disdainful of hearing aids?

"Sit down," she said, audibly striking her flanks with her palms. I relapsed into the black rocker.

"So you betrayed me? W here did you go? W here is he now?" She took from the mantelpiece a concave glossy snapshot. Old woman in white, stout, beam ing, bowlegged, very short dress; old man in his shirtsleeves, drooping mustache, watch chain. Her in-laws. Living with Dick's brother's fam ily in Juneau.

"Sure you don't want to sm oke?"

She was sm oking herself. First time I saw her doing it. Streng verboten under Humbert the Terrible. Graceful y, in a blue mist, Charlotte Haze rose from her grave. I would find him through Uncle Ivory if she refused.

"Betrayed you? No." She directed the dart of her cigarette, index rapidly tapping upon it, toward the hearth exactly as her mother used to do, and then, like her mother, oh my God, with her fingernail scratched and rem oved a fragm ent of cigarette paper from her underlip. No. She had not betrayed me. I was am ong friends. Edusa had warned her that Cue liked little girls, had been almost jailed once, in fact (nice fact), and he knew she knew. Yes . . . Elbow in palm, puff, sm ile, exhaled sm oke, darting gesture. W axing rem iniscent. He saw-sm iling-through everything and everybody, because he was not like me and her but a genius. A great guy. Ful of fun. Had rocked with laughter when she confessed about me and her, and said he had thought so. It was quite safe, under the circum stances, to tel him . . .

W el , Cue-they al cal ed him Cue-Her cam p five years ago. Curious coincidence-. . . took her to a dude ranch about a day's drive from Elephant (Elphinstone). Named? Oh, som e sil y nam e-Duk Duk Ranch-you know just plain sil y-but it did not matter now, anyway, because the place had vanished and disintegrated. Real y, she m eant, I could not imagine how utterly lush that ranch was, she m eant it had everything but everything, even an indoor waterfal . Did I rem em ber the red-haired guy we ("we" was good) had once had som e tennis with?

W el , the place real y belonged to Red's brother, but he had turned it over to Cue for the summer. W hen Cue and she cam e, the others had them actual y go through a coronation cerem ony and then-a terrific ducking, as when you cross the Equator. You know. Her eyes rol ed in synthetic resignation.

"Go on, please."

W el . The idea was he would take her in Septem ber to Hol ywood and arrange a tryout for her, a bit part in the tennis-match scene of a m ovie picture based on a play of hisGolden Guts-and perhaps even have her double one of its sensational starlets on the Klieg-struck tennis court. Alas, it never cam e to that.

"W here is the hog now?"

He was not a hog. He was a great guy in many respects. But it was al drink and drugs. And, of course, he was a com plete freak in sex matters, and his friends were his slaves. I Page 138

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

just could not imagine (I, Humbert, could not imagine!) what they al did at Duk Duk Ranch. She refused to take part because she loved him, and he threw her out.

"W hat things?"

"Oh, weird, filthy, fancy things. I m ean, he had two girls and tow boys, and three or four men, and the idea was for al of us to tangle in the nude while an old woman took m ovie pictures." (Sade's Justine was twelve at the start.)

"W hat things exactly?"

"Oh, things . . . Oh, I-real y I"-she uttered the "I" as a subdued cry while she listened to the source of the ache, and for lack of words spread the five fingers of her angularly up-anddown-m oving hand. No, she gave it up, she refused to go into particulars with that baby inside her.

That made sense.

"It is of no im portance now," she said pounding a gray cushing with her fist and then lying back, bel y up, on the divan. "Crazy things, filthy things. I said no, I'm just not going to [she used, in al insouciance real y, a disgusting slang term which, in a literal French translation, would be souffler] your beastly boys, because I want only you. W el , he kicked me out."

There was not much else to tel . That winter 1949, Fay and she had found jobs. For almost two years she had-oh, just drifted, oh, doing som e restaurant work in sm al places, and then she had met Dick. No, she did not know where the other was. In New York, she guessed. Of course, he was so fam ous she would have found him at once if she had wanted. Fay had tried to get back to the Ranch-and it just was not there any more-it had burned to the ground, nothing rem ained, just a charred heap of rubbish. It was so strange, so strange-She closed her eyes and opened her m outh, leaning back on the cushion, one felted foot on the floor. The wooden floor slanted, a little steel bal would have rol ed into the kitchen. I knew al I wanted to know. I had no intention of torturing my darling. Som ewhere beyond Bil 's shack an afterwork radio had begun singing of fol y and fate, and there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, ropeveined narrow hands and her goose-flesh white arms, and her shal ow ears, and her unkem pt armpits, there she was (my Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby, dream ing already in her of becom ing a big shot and retiring around 2020 A.D.and I looked and looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else. She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nym phet I had rol ed myself upon with such cries in the past; an echo on the brink of a russet ravine, with a far wood under a white sky, and brown leaves choking the brook, and one last cricket in the crisp weeds . . . but thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshipped. W hat I used to pam per am ong the tangled vines of my heart, m on grand pÃªchÃ© radieux, had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, al that I canceled and cursed. You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I wil shout my poor truth. I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and pol uted, and big with another's child, but stil gray-eyed, stil sooty-lashed, stil auburn and alm ond, stil Carmencita, stil mine; Changeons de vie, ma Carmen, al ons vivre quelque part oÃ¹ nous ne serons jam ais sÃ¨parÃ¨s; Ohio? The wilds of M

assachusetts? No matter, even if those eyes of hers would fade to m yopic fish, and her nipples swel and crack, and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torneven then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face, at the mere sound of your raucous young voice, my Lolita.

"Lolita," I said, "this may be neither here nor there but I have to say it. Life is very short. From here to that old car you know so wel thee is a stretch of twenty, twenty-five paces. It is a very short walk. M ake those twenty-five steps. Now. Right now. Com e just as you Page 139

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

are. And we shal live happily ever after."

Carmen, voulez-vous venir avec moi?

"You m ean," she said opening her eyes and raising herself slightly, the snake that may strike, "you m ean you wil give us [us] that m oney only if I go with you to a motel. Is that what you m ean?"

"No," I said, "you got it al wrong. I want you to leave your incidental Dick, and this awful hole, and com e to live with me, and die with me, and everything with me" (words to that effect).

"You're crazy," she said, her features working.

"Think it over, Lolita. There are no strings attached. Except, perhaps-wel , no matter." (A reprieve, I wanted to say but did not.) "Anyway, if you refuse you wil stil get your . .

. trousseau."

"No kidding?" asked Dol y.

I handed her an envelope with four hundred dol ars in cash and a check for three thousand six hundred more.

Gingerly, uncertainly, she received m on petit cadeau; and then her forehead becam e a beautiful pink. "You m ean," she said, with agonized em phasis, "you are giving us four thousand bucks?" I covered my face with my hand and broke into the hottest tears I had ever shed. I felt them winding through my fingers and down my chin, and burning me, and my nose got clogged, and I could not stop, and then she touched my wrist.

"I'l die if you touch me," I said. "You are sure you are not com ing with me? Is there no hope of your com ing? Tel me only this."

"No," she said. "No, honey, no."

She had never cal ed me honey before.

"No," she said, "it is quite out of the question. I would sooner go back to Cue. I m ean-" She groped for words. I supplied them mental y ("He broke my heart. You merely broke my life").

"I think," she went on-"oops"-the envelope skidded to the floor-she picked it up-"I think it's oh utterly grand of you to give us al that dough. It settles everything, we can start next week. Stop crying, please. You should understand. Let me get you som e more beer. Oh, don't cry, I'm so sorry I cheated so much, but that's the way things are." I wiped my face and my fingers. She sm iled at the cadeau. She exulted. She wanted to cal Dick. I said I would have to leave in a moment, did not want to see him at al , at al . W e tried to think of som e subject of conversation. For som e reason, I kept seeing-it trem bled and silkily glowed on my dam n retina-a radiant child of twelve, sitting on a threshold, "pinging" pebbles at an em pty can. I almost said-trying to find som e casual rem ark-"I wonder som etimes what has becom e of the little M cCoo girl, did she ever get better?"-but stopped in time lest she rejoin: "I wonder som etimes what has becom e of the little Haze girl . . ." Final y, I reverted to m oney matters. That sum , I said, represented more or less the net rent from her mother's house; she said: "Had it not been sold years ago?" No (I adm it I had told her this in order to sever al connections with R.); a lawyer would send a ful account of the financial situation later; it was rosy; som e of the sm al securities her mother had owned had gone up and up. Yes, I was quite sure I had to go. I had to go, and find him, and destroy him.

Since I would not have survived the touch of her lips, I kept retreating in a mincing dance, at every step she and her bel y made toward me.

She and the dog saw me off. I was surprised (this a rhetorical figure, I was not) that the sight of the old car in which she had ridden as a child and a nym phet, left her so very indifferent. Al she rem arked was it was getting sort of purplish about the gil s. I said it was hers, I could go by bus. She said don't be sil y, they would fly to Jupiter and buy a car there. I said I would buy this one from her for five hundred dol ars. Page 140

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"At this rate we'l be mil ionnaires next," she said to the ecstatic dog. Carmencita, lui dem andais-je . . . "One last word," I said in my horrible careful English,

"are you quite, quite sure that-wel , not tom orrow, of course, and not after tom orrow, butwel -some day, any day, you wil not com e to live with me? I wil create a brand new God and thank him with piercing cries, if you give me that microscopic hope" (to that effect).

"No," she said sm iling, "no."

"It would have made al the difference," said Humbert Humbert. Then I pul ed out my autom atic-I m ean, this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose I did. It never even occurred to me to do it.

"Good by-aye!" she changed, my American sweet immortal dead love; for she is dead and immortal if you are reading this. I m ean, such is the formal agreem ent with the socal ed authorities.

Then, as I drove away, I heard her shout in a vibrant voice to her Dick; and the dog started to lope alongside my car like a fat dolphin, but he was too heavy and old, and very soon gave up.

And presently I was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with the windshield wipers in ful action but unable to cope with my tears.

Leaving as I did Coalm ont around four in the afternoon (by Route X-I do not rem em ber the num ber(, I might have made Ram sdale by dawn had not a short-cut tem pted me. I had to get onto Highway Y. M y map showed quite blandly that just beyond W oodbine, which I reached at nightfal , I could leave paved X and reached paved Y by m eans of a transverse dirt road. It was only som e forty miles long according to my map. Otherwise I would have to fol ow X for another hundred miles and then use leisurely looping Z to get to Y and my destination. However, the short-cut in question got worse and worse, bum pier and bum pier, m uddier and m uddier, and when I attem pted to turn back after som e ten miles of purblind, tortuous and tortoise-slow progress, my old and weak M elmoth got stuck in deep clay. Al was dark and m uggy, and hopeless. M y headlights hung over a broad ditch ful of water. The surrounding country, if any, was a black wilderness. I sought to extricate myself but my rear wheels only whined in slosh and anguish. Cursing my plight, I took off my fancy clothes, changed into slacks, pul ed on the bul et-riddled sweater, and waded four miles back to a roadside farm. It started to rain on the way but I had not the strength to go back for a m ackintosh. Such incidents have convinced me that my heart is basical y sound despite recent diagnoses. Around midnight, a wrecker dragged my car out. I navigated back to Highway X and traveled on. Utter weariness overtook me and hour later, in an anonym ous little town. I pul ed up at the curb and in darkness drank deep from a friendly flask.

The rain had been canceled miles before. It was a black warm night, som ewhere in Appalachia. Now and then cars passed me, red tail-lights receding, white headlights advancing, but the town was dead. Nobody strol ed and laughed on the sidewalks as relaxing burghers would in sweet, mel ow, rotting Europe. I was alone to enjoy the innocent night and my terrible thoughts. A wire receptacle on the curb was very particular about acceptable contents: Sweepings. Paper. No Garbage. Sherry-red letters of light marked a Cam era Shop. A large thermometer with the nam e of a laxative quietly dwelt on the front of a drugstore. Rubinov's Jewelry com pany had a display of artificial diam onds reflected in a red mirror. A lighted green clock swam in the linenish depths of Jiffy Jeff Laundry. On the other side of the street a garage said in its sleep-genuflection lubricity; and corrected itself to Gulflex Lubrication. An airplane, also gemmed by Rubinov, passed, droning, in the velvet heavens. How many sm al dead-of-night towns I had seen! This was not yet the last.

Page 141

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

Let me dal y a little, he is as good as destroyed. Som e way further across the street, neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart: the outline of a restaurant sign, a large coffee-pot, kept bursting, every ful second or so, into em erald life, and every time it went out, pink letters saying Fine Foods relayed it, but the pot could stil be made out as a latent shadow teasing the eye before its next em erald resurrection. W e made shadowgraphs. This furtive burg was not far from The Enchanted Hunters. I was weeping again, drunk on the im possible past.

31

At this solitary stop for refreshm ents between Coalm ont and Ram sdale (between innocent Dol y Schil er and jovial Uncle Ivor), I reviewed my case. W ith the utmost simplicity and clarity I now saw myself and my love. Previous attem pts seem ed out of focus in com parison. A couple of years before, under the guidance of an intel igent Frenchspeaking confessor, to whom , in a moment of metaphysical curiosity, I had turned over a Protestant's drab atheism for an old-fashioned popish cure, I had hoped to deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a Suprem e Being. On those frosty mornings in rimelaced Quebec, the good priest worked on me with the finest tenderness and understanding. I am infinitely obliged to him and the great Institution he represented. Alas, I was unable to transcend the simple hum an fact that whatever spiritual solace I might find, whatever lithophanic eternities might be provided for me, nothing could make my Lolita forget the foul lust I had inflicted upon her. Unless it can be proven to me-to me as I am now, today, with my heart and by beard, and my putrefaction-that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl-child nam ed Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven (and if it can, then life is a joke), I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local pal iative of articulate art. To quote an old poet: The moral sense in mortals is the duty W e have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.

32

There was the day, during our first trip-our first circle of paradise-when in order to enjoy my phantasm s in peace I firmly decided to ignore what I could not help perceiving, the fact that I was to her not a boy friend, not a glam our man, not a pal, not even a person at al , but just two eyes and a foot of engorged brawn-to mention only mentionable matters. There was the day when having withdrawn the functional prom ise I had made her on the eve (whatever she had set her funny little heart on-a rol er rink with som e special plastic floor or a m ovie matinee to which she wanted to go alone), I happened to glimpse from the bathroom , through a chance com bination of mirror aslant and door ajar, a look on her face . . . that look I cannot exactly describe . . . an expression of helplessness so perfect that it seem ed to grade into one of rather com fortable inanity just because this was the very limit of injustice and frustration-and every limit presupposes som ething beyond it-hence the neutral il um ination. And when you bear in mind that these were the raised eyebrows and parted lips of a child, you may better appreciate what depths of calculated carnality, what reflected despair, restrained me from fal ing at her dear feet and dissolving in hum an tears, and sacrificing my jealousy to whatever pleasure Lolita might hope to derive from mixing with dirty and dangerous children in an outside world that was real to her.

And I have stil other sm othered memories, now unfolding them selves into limbless m onsters of pain. Once, in a sunset-ending street of Beardsley, she turned to little Eva Rosen (I was taking both nym phets to a concert and walking behind them so close as almost to touch them with my person), she turned to Eva, and so very serenely and seriously, in answer to som ething the other had said about its being better to die than hear M ilton Pinski, som e local schoolboy she knew, talk about music, my Lolita rem arked: Page 142

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"You know, what's so dreadful about dying is that you are com pletely on your own"; and it struck me, as my autom aton knees went up and down, that I simply did not know a thing about my darling's mind and that quite possibly, behind the awful juvenile clichÃ©s, there was in her a garden and a twilight, and a palace gate-dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me, in my pol uted rags and miserable convulsions; for I often noticed that living as we did, she and I, in a world of total evil, we would becom e strangely em barrassed whenever I tried to discuss som ething she and an older friend, she and a parent, she and a real healthy sweetheart, I and Annabel, Lolita and a sublime, purified, analyzed, deified Harold Haze, might have discussed-an abstract idea, a painting, stippled Hopkins or shorn Baudelaire, God or Shakespeare, anything of genuine kind. Good wil ! She would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom , whereas I, using for my desperately detached comments an artificial tone of voice that set my own last teeth on edge, provoked my audience to such outbursts of rudeness as made any further conversation im possible, oh my poor, bruised child.

I loved you. I was a pentapod m onster, but I loved you. I was despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything, mais je t'aimais, je t'aimais! And there were times when I knew how you felt, and it was hel to know it, my little one. Lolita girl, brave Dol y Schil er. I recal certain moments, let us cal them icebergs in paradise, when after having had my fil of her-after fabulous, insane exertions that left me limp and azure-barred-I would gather her in my arms with, at last, a mute moan of hum an tenderness (her skin glistening in the neon light com ing from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her sootblack lashes matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever-for al the world a little patient stil in the confusion of a drug after a major operation)-and the tenderness would deepen to sham e and despair, and I would lul and rock my lone light Lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the peak of this hum an agonized selfless tenderness (with my soul actual y hanging around her naked body and ready to repent), al at once, ironical y, horribly, lust would swel again-and "oh, no," Lolita would say with a sigh to heaven, and the next moment the tenderness and the azure-al would be shattered.

M id-twentieth century ideas concerning child-parent relationship have been considerably tainted by the scholastic rigm arole and standardized sym bols of the psychoanalytic racket, but I hope I am addressing myself to unbiased readers. Once when Avis's father had honked outside to signal papa had com e to take his pet hom e, I felt obliged to invite him into the parlor, and he sat down for a minute, and while we conversed, Avis, a heavy, unattractive, affectionate child, drew up to him and eventual y perched plum ply on his knee. Now, I do not rem em ber if I have mentioned that Lolita always had an absolutely enchanting sm ile for strangers, a tender furry slitting of the eyes, a dream y sweet radiance of al her features which did not m ean a thing of course, but was so beautiful, so endearing that one found it hard to reduce such sweetness to but a magic gene autom atical y lighting up her face in atavistic token of som e ancient rite of welcom e-hospitable prostitution, the coarse reader may say. W el , there she stood while M r. Byrd twirled his hat and talked, and-yes, look how stupid of me, I have left out the main characteristic of the fam ous Lolita sm ile, nam ely: while the tender, nectared, dimpled brightness played, it was never directed at the stranger in the room but hung in its own rem ote flowered void, so to speak, or wandered with m yopic softness over chance objects-and this is what was happening now: while fat Avis sidled up to her papa, Lolita gently beam ed at a fruit knife that she fingered on the edge of the table, whereon she leaned, many miles away from me. Suddenly, as Avis clung to her father's neck and ear while, with a casual arm, the man enveloped his lum py and large offspring, I saw Lolita's sm ile lose al its light and becom e a frozen little shadow of itself, and the fruit knife Page 143

slipped off the table and struck her with its silver handle a freak blow on the ankle which made her gasp, and crouch head forward, and then, jum ping on one leg, her face awful with the preparatory grim ace which children hold til the tears gush, she was gone-to be fol owed at once and consoled in the kitchen by Avis who had such a wonderful fat pink dad and a sm al chubby brother, and a brand-new baby sister, and a hom e, and two grinning dogs, and Lolita had nothing. And I have a neat pendant to that little scene-also in a Beardsley setting. Lolita, who had been reading near the fire, stretched herself, and then inquired, her elbow up, with a grunt: "W here is she buried anyway?" "W ho?"

"Oh, you know, my murdered mummy." "And you know where her grave is," I said control ing myself, whereupon I nam ed the cem etery-just outside Ram sdale, between the railway tracks and Lakeview Hil . "M oreover," I added, "the tragedy of such an accident is som ewhat cheapened by the epithet you saw fit to apply to it. If you real y wish to trium ph in your mind over the idea of death-" "Ray," said Lo for hurrah, and languidly left the room , and for a long while I stared with sm arting eyes into the fire. Then I picked up her book. It was som e trash for young people. There was a gloom y girl M

arion, and there was her stepm other who turned out to be, against al expectations, a young, gay, understanding redhead who explained to M arion that M arion's dead mother had real y been a heroic woman since she had deliberately dissimulated her great love for M arion because she was dying, and did not want her child to miss her. I did not rush up to her room with cries. I always preferred the mental hygiene of noninterference. Now, squirming and pleading with my own memory, I recal that on this and similar occasions, it was always my habit and method to ignore Lolita's states of mind while com forting my own base self. W hen my mother, in a livid wet dress, under the tum bling mist (so I vividly imagined her), had run panting ecstatical y up that ridge above M oulinet to be fel ed there by a thunderbolt, I was but an infant, and in retrospect no yearnings of the accepted kind could I ever graft upon any moment of my youth, no matter how savagely psychotherapists heckled me in my later periods of depression. But I adm it that a man of my power of imagination cannot plead personal ignorance of universal em otions. I may also have relied too much on the abnormal y chil relations between Charlotte and her daughter. But the awful point of the whole argum ent is this. It had becom e gradual y clear to my conventional Lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even the most miserable of fam ily lives was better than the parody of incest, which, in the long run, was the best I could offer the waif.

Ram sdale revisited. I approached it from the side of the lake. The sunny noon was al eyes. As I rode by in my m ud-flecked car, I could distinguish scintil as of diam ond water between the far pines. I turned into the cem etery and walked am ong the long and short stone m onum ents. Bonzhur, Charlotte. On som e of the graves there were pale, transparent little national flags slum ped in the windless air under the evergreens. Gee, Ed, that was bad luck-referring to G. Edward Grammar, a thirty-five-year-old New York office manager who had just been arrayed on a charge of murdering his thirty-three-yearold wife, Dorothy. Bidding for the perfect crime, Ed had bludgeoned his wife and put her into a car. The case cam e to light when two county policem en on patrol saw M rs. Grammar's new big blue Chrysler, an anniversary present from her husband, speeding crazily down a hil , just inside their jurisdiction (God bless our good cops!). The car sideswiped a pole, ran up an em bankm ent covered with beard grass, wild strawberry and cinquefoil, and overturned. The wheels were stil gently spinning in the mel ow sunlight when the officers rem oved M rs. G's body. It appeared to be routine highway accident at first. Alas, the woman's battered body did not match up with only minor dam age suffered by the car. I did better.

I rol ed on. It was funny to see again the slender white church and the enorm ous elms. Page 144

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

Forgetting that in an American suburban street a lone pedestrian is more conspicuous than a lone motorist, I left the car in the avenue to walk unobtrusively past 342 Lawn Street. Before the great bloodshed, I was entitled to a little relief, to a cathartic spasm of mental regurgitation. Closed were the white shutters of the Junk mansion, and som ebody had attached a found black velvet hair ribbon to the white FOR SALE sign which was leaning toward the sidewalk. No dog barked. No gardener telephoned. No M iss Opposite sat on the vined porch-where to the lone pedestrian's annoyance two ponytailed young women in identical polka-dotted pinafores stopped doing whatever they were doing to stare at him: she was long dead, no doubt, these might be her twin nieces from Philadelphia.

Should I enter my old house? As in a Turgenev story, a torrent of Italian music cam e from an open window-that of the living room : what rom antic soul was playing the piano where no piano had plunged and plashed on that bewitched Sunday with the sun on her beloved legs? Al at once I noticed that from the lawn I had mown a golden-skinned, brown-haired nym phet of nine or ten, in white shorts, was looking at me with wild fascination in her large blue-black eyes. I said som ething pleasant to her, m eaning no harm, an old-world com pliment, what nice eyes you have, but she retreated in haste and the music stopped abruptly, and a violent-looking dark man, glistening with sweat, cam e out and glared at me. I was on the point of identifying myself when, with a pang of dream

-em barrassm ent, I becam e aware of my m ud-caked dungarees, my filthy and torn sweater, my bristly chin, my bum 's bloodshot eyes. W ithout saying a word, I turned and plodded back the way I had com e. An aster-like anem ic flower grew out of a rem em bered chink in the sidewalk. Quietly resurrected, M iss Opposite was being wheeled out by her nieces, onto her porch, as if it were a stage and I the star performer. Praying she would not cal to me, I hurried to my car. W hat a steep little street. W hat a profound avenue. A red ticket showed between wiper and windshield; I careful y tore it into two, four, eight pieces.

Feeling I was losing my time, I drove energetical y to the downtown hotel where I had arrived with a new bag more than five years before. I took a room , made two appointments by telephone, shaved, bathed, put on black clothes and went down for a drink in the bar. Nothing had changed. The barroom was suffused with the sam e dim, im possible garnet-red light that in Europe years ago went with low haunts, but here m eant a bit of atm osphere in a fam ily hotel. I sat at the sam e little table where at the very start of my stay, immediately after becom ing Charlotte's lodger, I had thought fit to celebrate the occasion by suavely sharing with her half a bottle of cham pagne, which had fatal y conquered her poor brimming heart. As then, a m oon-faced waiter was arranging with stel ar care fifty sherries on a round tray for a wedding party. M urphy-Fantasia, this time. It was eight minutes to three. As I walked though the lobby, I had to skirt a group of ladies who with mil e grÃ¢ces were taking leave of each other after a luncheon party. W ith a harsh cry of recognition, one pounced upon me. She was a stout, short woman in pearlgray, with a long, gray, slim plum e to her sm al hat. It was M rs. Chatfield. She attacked me with a fake sm ile, al aglow with evil curiosity. (Had I done to Dol y, perhaps, what Frank Lasal e, a fifty-year-old m echanic, had done o eleven-year-old Sal y Horner in 1948?) Very soon I had that avid glee wel under control She thought I was in California. How was-? W ith exquisite pleasure I informed her that my stepdaughter had just married a bril iant young mining engineer with a hush-hush job in the Northwest. She said she disapproved of such early marriages, she would never let her Phil ys, who was now eighteen-"Oh yes, of course," I said quietly. "I rem em ber Phyl is. Phyl is and Cam p Q. yes, of course. By the way, did she ever tel you how Charlie Holmes debauched there his mother's little charges?"

Page 145

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

M rs. Chatfiled's already broken sm ile now disintegrated com pletely.

"For sham e," she cried, "for sham e, M r. Humbert! The poor boy has just been kil ed in Korea."

I said didn't she think "vient de," with the infinitive, expressed recent events so much more neatly than the English "just," with the past? But I had to be trotting off, I said. There were only two blocks to W indm ul er's office. He greeted me with a very slow, very enveloping, strong, searching grip. He thought I was in California. Had I not lived at one time at Beardsley? His daughter had just entered Beardsley Col ege. And how was-? I have al necessary information about M rs. Schil er. W e had a pleasant business conference. I walked out into the hot Septem ber sunshine a contented pauper. Now that everything had been put out of the way, I could dedicate myself freely to the main object of my visit to Ram sdale. In the methodical m anner on which I have always prided myself, I had been keeping Clare Quilty's face masked in my dark dungeon, where he was waiting for me to com e with barber and priest: "RÃ©veil ez-vous, Laqueue,il est tem ps de m ourir!" I have no time right now to discuss the m nem onics of physiognom ization-I am on my way to his uncle and walking fast-but let me jot down this: I had preserved in the alcohol of a clouded memory the toad of a face. In the course of a few glim pses, I had noticed its slight resem blance to a cheery and rather repulsive wine dealer, a relative of mine in Switzerland. W ith his dum bbel s and stinking tricot, and fat hairy arms, and bald patch, and pig-faced servant-concubine, he was on the whole a harmless old rascal. Too harmless, in fact, to be confused with my prey. In the state of mind I now found myself, I had lost contact with Trapp's image. It had becom e com pletely engulfed by the face of Clare Quilty-as represented, with artistic precision, by an easeled photograph of him that stood on his uncle's desk. In Beardsley, at the hands of charming Dr. M olnar, I had undergone a rather serious dental operation, retaining only a few upper and lower front teeth. The substitutes were dependent on a system of plates with an inconspicuous wire affair running along my upper gum s. The whole arrangem ent was a masterpiece of com fort, and my canines were in perfect health. However, to garnish my secret purpose with a plausible pretext, I told Dr. Quilty that, in hope of al eviating facial neuralgia, I had decided to have al my teeth rem oved. W hat would a com plete set of dentures cost? How long would the process take, assum ing we fixed our first appointment for som e time in Novem ber? W here was his fam ous nephew now? W

ould it be possible to have them al out in one dram atic session?

A white-sm ocked, gray-haired man, with a crew cut and the big flat cheeks of a politician, Dr. Quilty perched on the corner of his desk, one foot dream ily and seductively rocking as he launched on a glorious long-range plan. He would first provide me with provisional plates until the gum s settled. Then he would make me a perm anent set. He would like to have a look at that m outh of mine. He wore perforated pied shoes. He had not visited with the rascal since 1946, but supposed he could be found at his ancestral hom e, Grimm Road, not far from Parkington. It was a noble dream . His foot rocked, his gaze was inspired. It would cost me around six hundred. He suggested he take m easurem ents right away, and make the first set before starting operations. M y m outh was to him a splendid cave ful of priceless treasures, but I denied him entrance.

"No," I said. "On second thoughts, I shal have it al done by Dr. M olnar. His price is higher, but he is of course a much better dentist than you." I do not know if any of my readers wil ever have a chance to say that. It is a delicious dream feeling. Clare's uncle rem ained sitting on the desk, stil looking dream y, but his foot had stopped pushrocking the cradle of rosy anticipation. On the other hand, his nurse, a skeleton-thin, faded girl, with the tragic eyes of unsuccessful blondes, rushed after me so as to be able to slam the door in my wake.

A gas station attendant in Parkington explained to me very clearly how to get to Grimm Road. W ishing to be sure Quilty would be at hom e, I attem pted to ring him up but learned that his private telephone had recently been disconnected. Did that m ean he was gone? I started to drive to grimm Road, twelve miles north of the town. By that time night had eliminated most of the landscape and as I fol owed the narrow winding highway, a series of short posts, ghostly white, with reflectors, borrowed my own lights to indicate this or that curve. I could make out a dark val ey on one side of the road and wooded slopes on the other, and in front of me, like derelict snowflakes, moths drifted out of the blackness into my probing aura. At the twelfth mile, as foretold, a curiously hooded bridge sheathed me for a moment and, beyond it, a white-washed rock loom ed on the right, and a few car lengths further, on the sam e side, I turned off the highway up gravel y Grimm Road. For a couple of minutes al was dank, dark, dense forest. Then, Pavor M

anor, a wooden house with a turret, arose in a circular clearing. Its windows glowed yel ow and red; its drive was cluttered with half a dozen cars. I stopped in the shelter of the trees and abolished my lights to ponder the next m ove quietly. He would be surrounded by his henchm en and whores. I could not help seeing the inside of that festive and ram shackle castle in terms of "Troubled Teens," a story in one of her magazines, vague "orgies," a sinister adult with penele cigar, drugs, bodyguards. At least, he was there. I would return in the torpid morning.

Gently I rol ed back to town, in that old faithful car of mine which was serenely, almost cheerful y working for me. M y Lolita! There was stil a three-year-old bobby pin of hers in the depths of the glove com partment. There was stil that stream of pale moths siphoned out of the night by my headlights. Dark barns stil propped them selves up here and there by the roadside. People were stil going to the m ovies. W hile searching for night lodgings, I passed a drive-in. In a selenian glow, truly mystical in its contrast with the m oonless and m assive night, on a gigantic screen slanting away am ong dark drowsy fields, a thin phantom raised a gun, both he and his arm reduced to trem ulous dishwater by the oblique angle of that receding world,-and the next moment a row of trees shut off the gesticulation.

35

I left Insom nia Lodge next morning around eight and spent som e time in Parkington. Visions of bungling the execution kept obsessing me. Thinking that perhaps the cartridges in the autom atic had gone stale during a week of inactivity, I rem oved them and inserted a fresh batch. Such a thorough oil bath did I give Chum that now I could not get rid of the stuff. I bandaged him up with a rag, like a maimed limb, and used another rag to wrap up a handful of spare bul ets.

A thunderstorm accom panied me most of the way back to Grimm Road, but when I reached Pavor M anor, the sun was visible again, burning like a man, and the birds scream ed in the drenched and steam ing trees. The elaborate and decrepit house seem ed to stand in a kind of daze, reflecting as it were my own state, for I could not help realizing, as my feet touched the springy and insecure ground, that I had overdone the alcoholic stimulation business.

A guardedly ironic silence answered my bel . The garage, however, was loaded with his car, a black convertible for the nonce. I tried the knocker. Re-nobody. W ith a petulant snarl, I pushed the front door-and, how nice, it swung open as in a medieval fairy tale. Having softly closed it behind me, I made my way across a spacious and very ugly hal ; peered into an adjacent drawing room ; noticed a num ber of used glasses growing out of the carpet; decided that master was stil asleep in the master bedroom . Page 147

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

So I trudged upstairs. M y right hand clutched muffled Chum in my pocket, my left patted the sticky banisters. Of the three bedroom s I inspected, one had obviously been slept in that night. There was a library ful of flowers. There was a rather bare room with am ple and deep mirrors and a polar bear skin on the slippery floor. There were stil other room s. A happy though struck me. If and when master returned from his constitutional in the woods, or em erged from som e secret lair, it might be wise for an unsteady gunm an with a long job before him to prevent his playm ate from locking himself up in a room . Consequently, for at least five minutes I went about-lucidly insane, crazily calm, an enchanted and very tight hunter-turning whatever keys in whatever locks there were and pocketing more planned privacy than have m odern glam our-boxes, where the bathroom

, the only lockable locus, has to be used for the furtive needs of planned parenthood. Speaking of bathroom s-I was about to visit a third one when master cam e out of it, leaving a brief waterfal behind him. The corner of a passage did not quite conceal me. Gray-faced, baggy-eyed, fluffily disheveled in a scanty balding way, but stil perfectly recognizable, he swept by me in a purple bathrobe, very like one I had. He either did not notice me, or else dism issed me as som e fam iliar and innocuous hal ucination-and, showing me his hairy calves, he proceeded, sleepwalker-wise, downstairs. I pocketed my last key and fol owed him into the entrance hal . He had half opened his m outh and the front door, to peer out through a sunny chink as one who thinks he has heard a halfhearted visitor ring and recede. Then, stil ignoring the raincoated phantasm that had stopped in midstairs, master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hal from the drawing room , through which-taking it easy, knowing he was safe-I now went away from him, and in a bar-adorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped dirty Chum , talking care not to leave any oil stains on the chrom e-I think I got the wrong product, it was black and awful y m essy. In my usual meticulous way, I transferred naked Chum to a clean recess about me and made for the little boudoir. M y step, as I say, was springy-too springy perhaps for success. But my heart pounded with tiger joy, and I crunched a cocktail glass underfoot. M aster met me in the Oriental parlor.

"Now who are you?" he asked in a high hoarse voice, his hands thrust into his dressinggown pockets, his eyes fixing a point to the northeast of my head. "Are you by any chance Brewster?"

By now it was evident to everybody that he was in a fog and com pletely at my so-cal ed mercy. I could enjoy myself.

"That's right," I answered suavely. "Je suis M onsieur BrustÃ©re. Let us chat for a moment before we start."

He looked pleased. His sm udgy mustache twitched. I rem oved my raincoat. I was wearing a black suit, a black shirt, no tie. W e sat down in two easy chairs.

"You know," he said, scratching loudly his fleshy and gritty gray cheek and showing his sm al pearly teeth in a crooked grin, "you don't look like Jack Brewster. I m ean, the resem blance is not particularly striking. Som ebody told me he had a brother with the sam e telephone com pany."

To have him trapped, after those years of repentance and rage . . . To look at the black hairs on the back of his pudgy hands . . . To wander with a hundred eyes over his purple silks and hirsute chest foreglimpsing the punctures, and m ess, and music of pain . . . To know that this sem i-animated, subhum an trickster who had sodom ized my darling-oh, my darling, this was intolerable bliss!

"No, I am afraid I am neither of the Brewsters."

"He cocked his head, looking more pleased than ever.

"Guess again, Punch."

"Ah," said Punch, "so you have not com e to bother me about those long-distance cal s?"

"You do make them once in a while, don't you?"

Page 148

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

"Excuse me?"

I said I had said I thought he had said he had never-"People," he said, "people in general, I'm not accusing you, Brewster, but you know it's absurd the way people invade this dam ned house without even knocking. They use the vaterre, they use the kitchen, they use the telephone. Phil cal s Philadelphia. Pat cal s Patagonia. I refuse to pay. You have a funny accent, Captain."

"Quilty," I said, "do you recal a little girl cal ed Dolores Haze, Dol y Haze? Dol y cal ed Dolores, Colo.?"

"Sure, she may have made those cal s, sure. Any place. Paradise, W ash., Hel Canyon. W ho cares?"

"I do, Quilty. You see, I am her father."

"Nonsense," he said. "You are not. You are som e foreign literary agent. A Frenchm an once translated my Proud Flesh as La FiertÃ© de la Chair. Absurd."

"She was my child, Quilty."

In the state he was in he could not real y be taken aback by anything, but his blustering m anner was not quite convincing. A sort of wary inkling kindled his eyes into a sem blance of life. They were immediately dul ed again.

"I'm very fond of children myself," he said, "and fathers are am ong my best friends." He turned his head away, looking for som ething. He beat his pockets. He attem pted to rise from his seat.

"Down!" I said-apparently much louder than I intended.

"You need not roar at me," he com plained in his strange fem inine m anner. "I just wanted a sm oke. I'm dying for a sm oke."

"You're dying anyway."

"Oh, chucks," he said. "You begin to bore me. W hat do you want? Are you French, mister? W ooly-woo-boo-are? Let's go to the barroom ette and have a stiff-" He saw the little dark weapon lying in my palm as if I were offering it to him.

"Say!" he drawled (now imitating the underworld num skul of m ovies), "that's a swel little gun you've got there. W hat d'you want for her?"

I slapped down his outstretched hand and he m anaged to knock over a box on a low table near him. It ejected a handful of cigarettes.

"Here they are," he said cheerful y. "You recal Kipling: une femme est une femme, mais un Caporal est une cigarette? Now we need matches."

"Quilty," I said. "I want you to concentrate. You are going to die in a moment. The hereafter for al we know may be an eternal state of excruciating insanity. You sm oked your last cigarette yesterday. Concentrate. Try to understand what is happening to you." He kept taking the Drom e cigarette apart and m unching bits of it.

"I am wil ing to try," he said. "You are either Australian, or a German refugee. M ust you talk to me? This is a Gentile's house, you know. M aybe, you'd better run along. And do stop dem onstrating that gun. I've an old Stern-Luger in the music room ." I pointed Chum at his slippered foot and crushed the trigger. It clicked. He looked at his foot, at the pistol, again at his foot. I made another awful effort, and, with a ridiculously feeble and juvenile sound, it went off. The bul et entered the thick pink rug, and I had the paralyzing impression that it had merely trickled in and might com e out again.

"See what I m ean?" said Quilty. "You should be a little more careful. Give me that thing for Christ's sake."

He reached for it. I pushed him back into the chair. The rich joy was waning. It was high time I destroyed him, but he must understand why he was being destroyed. His condition infected me, the weapon felt limp and clum sy in my hand.

"Concentrate," I said, "on the thought of Dol y Haze whom you kidnapped-"

"I did not!" he cried. "You're al wet. I saved her from a beastly pervert. Show me your Page 149

badge instead of shooting at my foot, you ape, you. W here is that badge? I'm not responsible for the rapes of others. Absurd! That joy ride, I grant you, was a sil y stunt but you got her back, didn't you? Com e, let's have a drink." I asked him whether he wanted to be executed sitting or standing.

"Ah, let me think," he said. "It is not an easy question. Incidental y-I made a mistake. W

hich I sincerely regret. You see, I had no fun with your Dol y. I am practical y im potent, to tel the melancholy truth. And I gave her a splendid vacation. She met som e rem arkable people. Do you happen to know-"

And with a trem endous lurch he fel al over me, sending the pistol hurtling under a chest of drawers. Fortunately he was more impetuous than vigorous, and I had little difficulty in shoving him back into his chair.

He puffed a little and folded his arms on his chest.

"Now you've done it," he said. "Vous voilÃ dans de beaux draps, m on vieux." His French was improving.

I looked around. Perhaps, if-Perhaps I could-On my hands and knees? Risk it?

"Alors, que fait-on?" he asked watching me closely. I stooped. He did not m oved. I stooped lower.

"M y dear sir," he said, "stop trifling with life and death. I am a playwright. I have written tragedies, com edies, fantasies. I have made private m ovies out of Justine and other eighteenth-century sexcapades. I'm the author of fifty-two successful scenarios. I know al the ropes. Let me handle this. There should be a poker som ewhere, why don't I fetch it, and then we'l fish out your property."

Fussily, busybodily, cunningly, he had risen again while he talked. I groped under the chest trying at the sam e time to keep an eye on him. Al of a sudden I noticed that he had noticed that I did not seem to have noticed Chum protruding from beneath the other corner of the chest. W e fel to wrestling again. W e rol ed al over the floor, in each other's arms, like two huge helpless children. He was naked and goatish under his robe, and I felt suffocated as he rol ed over me. I rol ed over him. W e rol ed over me. They rol ed over him. W e rol ed over us.

In its published form, this book is being read, I assum e, in the first years of 2000 A.D. (1935 plus eighty or ninety, live long, my love); and elderly readers wil surely recal at this point the obligatory scene in the W esterns of their childhood. Our tussle, however, lacked the ox-stunning fisticuffs, the flying furniture. He and I were two large dummies, stuffed with dirty cotton and rags. It was a silent, soft, formless tussle on the part of two literati, one of whom was utterly disorganized by a drug while the other was handicapped by a heart condition and too much gin. W hen at last I had possessed myself of my precious weapon, and the scenario writer had been reinstal ed in his low chair, both of us were panting as the cowm an and the sheepm an never do after their battle. I decided to inspect the pistol-our sweat might have spoiled som ething-and regain my wind before proceeding to the main item in the program . To fil in the pause, I proposed he read his own sentence-in the poetical form I had given it. The term "poetical justice" is one that may be most happily used in this respect. I handed him a neat typescript.

"Yes," he said, "splendid idea. Let me fetch my reading glasses" (he attem pted to rise).

"No."

"Just as you say. Shal I read out loud?"

"Yes."

"Here goes. I see it's in verse.

"W el , sir, this is certainly a fine poem . Your best as far as I'm concerned." He folded and handed it back to me.

I asked him if he had anything serious to say before dying. The autom atic was again ready for use on the person. He looked at it and heaved a big sigh.

"Now look here, M ac," he said. "You are drunk and I am a sick man. Let us postpone the matter. I need quiet. I have to nurse my im potence.

M y memory and my eloquence are not at their best today, but real y, my dear M r. Humbert, you were not an ideal stepfather, and I did not force your little protÃ©gÃ© to join me. It was she made me rem ove her to a happier hom e. This house is not as m odern as that ranch we shared with dear friends. But it is room y, cool in summer and winter, and in a word com fortable, so, since I intend retiring to England or Florence forever, I suggest you m ove in. It is yours, gratis. Under the condition you stop pointing at me that [he swore disgustingly] gun. By the way, I do not know if you care for the bizarre, but if you do, I can offer you, also gratis, as house pet, a Page 151

Vladimir Nabokov: Lolita

rather exciting little freak, a young lady with three breasts, one a dandy, this is a rare and delightful marvel of nature. Now, soyons raisonnables. You wil only wound me hideously and then rot in jail while I recuperate in a tropical setting. I prom ise you, Brewster, you wil be happy here, with a magnificent cel ar, and al the royalties from my next play-I have not much at the bank right now but I propose to borrow-you know, as the Bard said, with that cold in his head, to borrow and to borrow and to borrow. There are other advantages. W e have here a most reliable and bribable charwoman, a M rs. Vibrissacurious nam e-who com es from the vil age twice a week, alas not today, she has daughters, granddaughters, a thing or two I know about the chief of police makes him my slave. I am a playwright. I have been cal ed the American M aeterlinck. M aeterlinckSchm etterling, says I. Com e on! Al this is very hum iliating, and I am not sure I am doing the right thing. Never use herculanita with rum . Now drop that pistol like a good fel ow. I knew your dear wife slightly. You may use my wardrobe. Oh, another thing-you are going to like this. I have an absolutely unique col ection of erotica upstairs. Just to mention one item : the in folio de-luxe Bagration Island by the explorer and psychoanalyst M elanie W

eiss, a rem arkable lady, a rem arkable work-drop that gun-with photographs of eight hundred and som ething male organs she exam ined and m easured in 1932 on Bagration, in the Barda Sea, very il um inating graphs, plotted with love under pleasant skies-drop that gun-and moreover I can arrange for you to attend executions, not everybody knows that the chair is painted yel ow-"

Feu. This time I hit som ething hard. I hit the back of a black rocking chair, not unlike Dol y Schil er's-m y bul et hit the inside surface of its back whereupon it immediately went into a rocking act, so fast and with such zest that any one com ing into the room might have been flabbergasted by the double miracle: that chair rocking in a panic al by itself, and the armchair, where my purple target had just been, now void of al life content. W iggling his fingers in the air, with a rapid heave of his rum p, he flashed into the music room and the next second we were tugging and gasping on both sides of the door which had a key I had overlooked. I won again, and with another abrupt m ovem ent Clare the Impredictable sat down before the piano and played several atrociously vigorous, fundam ental y hysterical, plangent chords, his jowls quivering, his spread hands tensely plunging, and his nostrils em itting the soundtrack snorts which had been absent from our fight. Stil singing those im possible sonorities, he made a futile attem pt to open with his foot a kind of seam an's chest near the piano. M y next bul et caught him som ewhere in the side, and he rose from his chair higher and higher, like old, gray, mad Nijinski, like Old faithful, like som e old nightmare of mine, to a phenom enal altitude, or so it seem ed, as he rent the air-stil shaking with the rich black music-head thrown back in a howl, hand pressed to his brow, and with his other hand clutching his armpit as if stung by a hornet, down he cam e on his heels and, again a normal robed man, scurried out into the hal .

I see myself fol owing him through the hal , with a kind of double, triple, kangaroo jum p, rem aining quite straight on straight legs while bouncing up twice in his wake, and then bouncing between him and the front door in a bal et-like stiff bounce, with the purpose of heading him off, since the door was not properly closed.

Suddenly dignified, and som ewhat morose, he started to walk up the broad stairs, and, shifting my position, but not actual y fol owing him up the steps, I fired three or four times in quick succession, wounding him at every blaze; and every time I did it to him, that horrible thing to him, his face would twitch in an absurd clownish m anner, as if he were exaggerating the pain; he slowed down, rol ed his eyes half closing them and made a fem inine "ah!" and he shivered every time a bul et hit him as if I were tickling him, and every time I got him with those slow, clum sy, blind bul ets of mine, he would say under his breath, with a phony British accent-al the while dreadful y twitching, shivering, Page 152

sm irking, but withal talking in a curiously detached and even am iable m anner: "Ah, that hurts, sir, enough! Ah, that hurts atrociously, my dear fel ow. I pray you, desist. Ah-very painful, very painful, indeed . . . God! Hah! This is abom inable, you should real y not-" His voice trailed off as he reached the landing, but he steadily walked on despite al the lead I had lodged in his bloated body-and in distress, in dism ay, I understood that far from kil ing him I was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fel ow, as if the bul ets had been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced.

I reloaded the thing with hands that were black and bloody-I had touched som ething he had anointed with his thick gore. Then I rejoined him upstairs, the keys jangling in my pockets like gold.

He was trudging from room to room , bleeding majestical y, trying to find an open window, shaking his head, and stil trying to talk me out of murder. I took aim at his head, and he retired to the master bedroom with a burst of royal purple where his ear had been.

"Get out, get out of here," he said coughing and spitting; and in a nightmare of wonder, I saw this blood-spattered but stil buoyant person get into his bed and wrap himself up in the chaotic bedclothes. I hit him at very close range through the blankets, and then he lay back, and a big pink bubble with juvenile connotations formed on his lips, grew to the size of a toy bal oon, and vanished.

I may have lost contact with reality for a second or two-oh, nothing of the I-justblackedout sort that your com m on criminal enacts; on the contrary, I want to stress the fact that I was responsible for every shed drop of his bubbleblood; but a kind of momentary shift occurred as if I were in the connubial bedroom , and Charlotte were sick in bed. Quilty was a very sick man. I held one of his slippers instead of the pistol-I was sitting on the pistol. Then I made myself a little more com fortable in the chair near the bed, and consulted my wrist watch. The crystal was gone but it ticked. The whole sad business had taken more than an hour. He was quiet at last. Far from feeling any relief, a burden even weightier than the one I had hoped to get rid of was with me, upon me, over me. I could not bring myself to touch him in order to make sure he was real y dead. He looked it: a quarter of his face gone, and two flies beside them selves with a dawning sense of unbelievable luck. M y hands were hardly in better condition than his. I washed up as best I could in the adjacent bathroom . Now I could leave. As I em erged on the landing, I was am azed to discover that a vivacious buzz I had just been dism issing as a mere singing in my ears was real y a medley of voices and radio music com ing from the downstairs drawing room .

I found there a num ber of people who apparently had just arrived and were cheerful y drinking Quilty's liquor. There was a fat man in an easy chair; and two dark-haired pale young beauties, sisters no doubt, big one and sm al one (almost a child), dem urely sat side by side on a davenport. A florid-faced fel ow with sapphire-blue eyes was in the act of bringing two glasses out of the bar-like kitchen, where two or three women were chatting and chinking ice. I stopped in the doorway and said: "I have just kil ed Clare Quilty." "Good for you," said the florid fel ow as he offered one of the drinks to the elder girl. "Som ebody ought to have done it long ago," rem arked the fat man. "W hat does he say, Tony?" asked a faded blonde from the bar. "He says," answered the florid fel ow, "he has kil ed Cue." "W el ," said another unidentified man rising in a corner where he had been crouching to inspect som e records, "I guess we al should do it to him som e day."

"Anyway," said Tony, "he'd better com e down. W e can't wait for him much longer if we want to go to that gam e." "Give this man a drink som ebody," said the fat person. "W hat a beer?" said a woman in slacks, showing it to me from afar. Only the two girls on the davenport, both wearing black, the younger fingering a bright som ething about her white neck, only they said nothing, but just sm iled on, so young, so Page 153

lewd. As the music paused for a moment, there was a sudden noise on the stairs. Tony and I stepped out into the hal . Quilty of al people had m anaged to crawl out onto the landing, and there we could see him, flapping and heaving, and then subsiding, forever this time, in a purple heap.

"Hurry up, Cue," said Tony with a laugh. "I believe, he's stil -" He returned to the drawing room , music drowned the rest of the sentence.

This, I said to myself, was the end of the ingenious play staged for me by Quilty. W ith a heavy heart I left the house and walked though the spotted blaze of the sun to my car. Two other cars were parked on both sides of it, and I had som e trouble squeezing out. 36

The rest is a little flattish and faded. Slowly I drove downhil , and presently found myself going at the sam e lazy pace in a direction opposite to Parkington. I had left my raincoat in the boudoir and Chum in the bathroom . No, it was not a house I would have liked to live in. I wondered idly if som e surgeon of genius might not alter his own career, and perhaps the whole destiny of m ankind, by reviving quilted Quilty, Clare Obscure. Not that I cared; on the whole I wished to forget the whole m ess-and when I did learn he was dead, the only satisfaction it gave me, was the relief of knowing I need not mental y accom pany for m onths a painful and disgusting convalescence interrupted by al kinds of unm entionable operations and relapses, and perhaps an actual visit from him, with trouble on my part to rationalize him as not being a ghost. Thom as had som ething. It is strange that the tactile sense, which is so infinitely less precious to men than sight, becom es at critical moment our main, if not only, handle to reality. I was al covered with Quilty-with the feel of that tum ble before the bleeding. The road now stretched across open country, and it occurred to m e-not by way of protest, not as a sym bol, or anything like that, but merely as a novel experience-that since I had disregarded al laws of hum anity, I might as wel disregard the rules of traffic. So I crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling, and the feeling was good. It was a pleasant diaphragm al melting, with elem ents of diffused tactility, al this enhanced by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road. In a way, it was a very spiritual itch. Gently, dream ily, not exceeding twenty miles an hour, I drove on that queer mirror side. Traffic was light. Cars that now and then passed me on the side I had abandoned to them , honked at me brutal y. Cars com ing towards me wobbled, swerved, and cried out in fear. Presently I found myself approaching populated places. Passing through a red light was like a sip of forbidden Burgundy when I was a child. M eanwhile com plications were arising. I was being fol owed and escorted. Then in front of me I saw two cars placing them selves in such a m anner as to com pletely block my way. W ith a graceful m ovem ent I turned off the road, and after two or three big bounces, rode up a grassy slope, am ong surprised cows, and there I cam e to a gentle rocking stop. A kind of thoughtful Hegelian synthesis linking up two dead women.

I was soon to be taken out of the car (Hi, M elmoth, thanks a lot, old fel ow)-and was, indeed, looking forward to surrender myself to many hands, without doing anything to cooperate, while they m oved and carried me, relaxed, com fortable, surrendering myself lazily, like a patient, and deriving an eerie enjoym ent from my lim pness and the absolutely reliable support given me by the police and the am bulance people. And while I was waiting for them to run up to me on the high slope, I evoked a last mirage of wonder and hopelessness. One day, soon after her disappearance, an attack of abom inable nausea forced me to pul up on the ghost of an old m ountain road that now accom panied, now traversed a brand new highway, with its population of asters bathing in the detached warmth of a pale-blue afternoon in late summer. After coughing myself inside out, I rested a while on a boulder, and then, thinking the sweet air might do me good, walked a Page 154

little way toward a low stone parapet on the precipice side of the highway. Sm al grasshoppers spurted out of the withered roadside weeds. A very light cloud was opening its arms and m oving toward a slightly more substantial one belonging to another, more sluggish, heavenlogged system . As I approached the friendly abyss, I grew aware of a melodious unity of sounds rising like vapor from a sm al mining town that lay at my feet, in a fold of the val ey. One could make out the geom etry of the streets between blocks of red and gray roofs, and green puffs of trees, and a serpentine stream

, and the rich, ore-like glitter of the city dum p, and beyond the town, roads crisscrossing the crazy quilt of dark and pale fields, and behind it al , great timbered m ountains. But even brighter than those quietly rejoicing colors-for there are colors and shades that seem to enjoy them selves in good com pany-both brighter and dream ier to the ear than they were to the eye, was that vapory vibration of accum ulated sounds that never ceased for a moment, as it rose to the lip of granite where I stood wiping my foul m outh. And soon I realized that al these sounds were of one nature, that no other sounds but these cam e from the streets of the transparent town, with the women at hom e and the men away. Reader! W hat I heard was but the melody of children at play, nothing but that, and so limpid was the air that within this vapor of blended voices, majestic and minute, rem ote and magical y near, frank and divinely enigm atic-one could hear now and then, as if released, an almost articulate spurt of vivid laughter, or the crack of a bat, or the clatter of a toy wagon, but it was al real y too far for the eye to distinguish any m ovem ent in the lightly etched streets. I stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope, to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of dem ure murmur for background, and then I knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita's absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from that concord.

This then is my story. I have reread it. It has bits of marrow sticking to it, and blood, and beautiful bright-green flies. At this or that twist of it I feel my slippery self eluding me, gliding into deeper and darker waters than I care to probe. I have cam ouflaged what I could so as not to hurt people. And I have toyed with many pseudonym s for myself before I hit on a particularly apt one. There are in my notes "Otto Otto" and "M esm er M

esmer" and "Lam bert Lam bert," but for som e reason I think my choice expresses the nastiness best.

W hen I started, fifty-six days ago, to write Lolita, first in the psychopathic ward for observation, and then in this wel -heated, albeit tom bal, seclusion, I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul. In mindcom position, however, I realized that I could not parade living Lolita. I stil may use parts of this memoir in hermetic sessions, but publication is to be deferred. For reasons that may appear more obvious than they real y are, I am opposed to capital punishm ent; this attitude wil be, I trust, shared by the sentencing judge. Had I com e before myself, I would have given Humbert at least thirty-five years for rape, and dism issed the rest of the charges. But even so, Dol y Schil er wil probably survive me by many years. The fol owing decision I make with al the legal im pact and support of a signed testam ent: I wish this memoir to be published only when Lolita is no longer alive. Thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book. But while the blood stil throbs through my writing hand, you are stil as much part of blessed matter as I am , and I can stil talk to you from here to Alaska. Be true to your Dick. Do not let other fel ows touch you. Do not talk to strangers. I hope you wil love your baby. I hope it wil be a boy. That husband of yours, I hope, wil always treat you wel , because otherwise my specter shal com e at him, like black sm oke, like a dem ented giant, and pul him apart nerve by nerve. And do not pity C. Q. One had to choose between him and H.H., and one wanted H.H. to exist at least a couple of m onths longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of Page 155

durable pigm ents, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita.
